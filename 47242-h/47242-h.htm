<h2>SLANDER, A WARNING</h2>


<p>A terrible thing is ignorance, the source of endless human
woes, spreading a mist over facts, obscuring truth, and casting
a gloom upon the individual life. We are all walkers in darkness&mdash;or
say, our experience is that of blind men, knocking helplessly
against the real, and stepping high to clear the imaginary,
failing to see what is close at their feet, and in terror of being
hurt by something that is leagues away. Whatever we do,
we are perpetually slipping about. This it is that has found
the tragic poets a thousand themes, Labdacids, Pelopids, and
all their kind. Inquiry would show that most of the calamities
put upon the boards are arranged by ignorance as by some
supernatural stage-manager. This is true enough as a generality;
but I refer more particularly to the false reports about
intimates and friends that have ruined families, razed cities,
driven fathers into frenzy against their offspring, embroiled
brother with brother, children with parents, and lover with
beloved. Many are the friendships that have been cut short,
many the households set by the ears, because slander has found
ready credence.</p>

<p>By way of precaution against it, then, it is my design to
sketch the nature, the origin, and effects of slander, though
indeed the picture is already in existence, by the hand of Apelles.
He had been traduced in the ears of Ptolemy as an accomplice
of Theodotas in the Tyrian conspiracy. As a matter of fact
he had never seen Tyre, and knew nothing of Theodotas beyond
the information that he was an officer of Ptolemy's in charge of
Phoenicia. However, that did not prevent another painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
called Antiphilus, who was jealous of his court influence and
professional skill, from reporting his supposed complicity to
Ptolemy: he had seen him at Theodotas's table in Phoenicia,
whispering in his ear all through dinner; he finally got as far
as making Apelles out prime instigator of the Tyrian revolt and
the capture of Pelusium.</p>

<p>Ptolemy was not distinguished for sagacity; he had been
brought up on the royal diet of adulation; and the incredible
tale so inflamed and carried him away that the probabilities of
the case never struck him: the traducer was a professional
rival; a painter's insignificance was hardly equal to the part;
and this particular painter had had nothing but good at his
hands, having been exalted by him above his fellows. But no,
he did not even find out whether Apelles had ever made a
voyage to Tyre; it pleased him to fall into a passion and make
the palace ring with denunciations of the ingrate, the plotter,
the conspirator. Luckily one of the prisoners, between disgust
at Antiphilus's effrontery and compassion for Apelles, stated
that the poor man had never been told a word of their designs;
but for this, he would have paid with his head for his non-complicity
in the Tyrian troubles.</p>

<p>Ptolemy was sufficiently ashamed of himself, we learn, to
make Apelles a present of &pound;25,000, besides handing Antiphilus
over to him as a slave. The painter was impressed by his
experience, and took his revenge upon Slander in a picture.</p>

<p>On the right sits a man with long ears almost of the Midas
pattern, stretching out a hand to Slander, who is still some way
off, but coming. About him are two females whom I take
for Ignorance and Assumption. Slander, approaching from the
left, is an extraordinarily beautiful woman, but with a heated,
excitable air that suggests delusion and impulsiveness; in her
left hand is a lighted torch, and with her right she is haling a
youth by the hair; he holds up hands to heaven and calls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Gods to witness his innocence. Showing Slander the way is
a man with piercing eyes, but pale, deformed, and shrunken as
from long illness; one may easily guess him to be Envy. Two
female attendants encourage Slander, acting as tire-women,
and adding touches to her beauty; according to the <i>cicerone</i>,
one of these is Malice, and the other Deceit. Following behind
in mourning guise, black-robed and with torn hair, comes (I
think he named her) Repentance. She looks tearfully behind
her, awaiting shame-faced the approach of Truth. That was
how Apelles translated his peril into paint.</p>

<p>I propose that we too execute in his spirit a portrait of Slander
and her surroundings; and to avoid vagueness let us start with
a definition or outline. Slander, we will say, is an undefended
indictment, concealed from its object, and owing its success to
one-sided half-informed procedure. Now we have something
to go upon. Further, our actors, as in comedy<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, are three&mdash;the
slanderer, the slandered, and the recipient of the slander;
let us take each in turn and see how his case works out.</p>

<p>And first for our chief character, the manufacturer of the
slander. That he is not a good man needs no proof; no good
man will injure his neighbour; good men's reputation, and
their credit for kindness, is based on the benefits they confer
upon their friends, not on unfounded disparagement of others
and the ousting of them from their friends' affections.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is easy to realize that such a person offends
against justice, law, and piety, and is a pest to all who associate
with him. Equality in everything, and contentment with your
proper share, are the essentials of justice; inequality and over-reaching,
of injustice; <i>that</i> every one will admit. It is not
less clear that the man who secretly slanders the absent is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>guilty of over-reaching; he is insisting on entire possession of
his hearer, appropriating and enclosing his ears, guarding them
against impartiality by blocking them with prejudice. Such
procedure is unjust to the last degree; we have the testimony
of the best lawgivers for that; Solon and Draco made every
juror swear that he would hear indifferently, and view both
parties with equal benevolence, till the defence should have
been compared with the prosecution and proved better or
worse than it. Before such balancing of the speeches, they
considered that the forming of a conclusion must be impious
and unholy. We may indeed literally suppose Heaven to be
offended, if we license the accuser to say what he will, and then,
closing our own ears or the defendant's mouth, allow our judgement
to be dictated by the first speech. No one can say, then,
that the uttering of slander is reconcilable with the requirements
of justice, of law, or of the juror's oath. If it is objected
that the lawgivers are no sufficient authority for such extreme
justice and impartiality, I fall back on the prince of poets, who
has expressed a sound opinion, or let me say, laid down a sound
law on the subject:</p>

<p class="center">Nor give thy judgement, till both sides are heard.
</p>

<p>He too was doubtless very well aware that, of all the ills that
flesh is heir to, none is more grievous or more iniquitous than
that a man should be condemned unjudged and unheard. That
is precisely what the slanderer tries to effect by exposing the
slandered without trial to his hearer's wrath, and precluding
defence by the secrecy of his denunciation.</p>

<p>Every such person is a skulker and a coward; he will not
come into the open; he is an ambuscader shooting from a
lurking-place, whose opponent cannot meet him nor have it
out with him, but must be shot down helplessly before he
knows that war is afoot; there could be no clearer proof that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
his allegations are baseless. Of course a man who knows he is
bringing true charges does the exposure in public, challenges
inquiry, and faces examination; just so no one who can win
a pitched battle will resort to ambush and deceit.</p>

<p>It is in kings' courts that these creatures are mostly found;
they thrive in the atmosphere of dominion and power, where
envy is rife, suspicions innumerable, and the opportunities for
flattery and back-biting endless. Where hopes are higher, there
envy is more intense, hatred more reckless, and jealousy more
unscrupulous. They all keep close watch upon one another,
spying like duellists for a weak spot. Every one would be first,
and to that end shoves and elbows his neighbour aside, and does
his best to pull back or trip the man in front of him. One
whose equipment is limited to goodness is very soon thrown
down, dragged about, and finally thrust forth with ignominy;
while he who is prepared to flatter, and can make servility
plausible, is high in credit, gets first to his end, and triumphs.
These people bear out the words of Homer:</p>

<p class="center">Th' impartial War-God slayeth him that slew.
</p>

<p>Convinced that the prize is great, they elaborate their mutual
stratagems, among which slander is at once the speediest and
the most uncertain; high are the hopes with which this child
of envy or hatred is born; pitiful, gloomy and disastrous the
end to which it comes.</p>

<p>Success is by no means the easy simple matter it may be supposed;
it demands much skill and tact, with the most concentrated
attention. Slander would never do the harm it does,
if it were not made plausible; it would never prevail against
truth, that strongest of all things, if it were not dressed up into
really attractive bait.</p>

<p>The chief mark for it is the man who is in favour, and therefore
enviable in the eyes of his distanced competitors; they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
regard him as standing in their light, and let fly at him; every
one thinks he will be first if he can only dispose of this conspicuous
person and spoil him of his favour. You may see the
same thing among runners at the games. The good runner,
from the moment the barrier falls, simply makes the best of
his way; his thoughts are on the winning-post, his hopes of
victory in his feet; he leaves his neighbour alone and does not
concern himself at all with his competitors. It is the ill qualified,
with no prospect of winning by his speed, who resorts to foul
play; his one pre-occupation is how he may stop, impede, curb
the real runner, because failing that his own victory is out of
the question. The persons we are concerned with race in like
manner for the favour of the great. The one who forges ahead
is at once the object of plots, is taken at a disadvantage by his
enemies when his thoughts are elsewhere, and got rid of, while
they get credit for devotion by the harm they do to others.</p>

<p>The credibility of the slander is by no means left to take care
of itself; it is the chief object of their solicitude; they are
extremely cautious against inconsistencies or contradictions.
The usual method is to seize upon real characteristics of a victim,
and only paint these in darker colours, which allows verisimilitude.
A man is a doctor; they make him out a poisoner;
wealth figures as tyranny; the tyrant's ready tool is a ready
traitor too.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the hint is taken from the hearer's own
nature; the villains succeed by using a bait that will tempt
<i>him</i>. They know he is jealous, and they tell him: 'He beckoned
to your wife at dinner, and sighed as he gazed at her; and
Stratonice&mdash;well, did not seem offended.' Or he writes poetry,
and piques himself upon it; then, 'Philoxenus had great sport
pulling your poem to pieces&mdash;said the metre was faulty and the
composition vile.' A devout religious person is told that his
friend is an atheist and a blasphemer, rejects belief and denies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Providence. That is quite enough; the venom has entered at
the ear and inflamed the brain; the man does not wait for confirmation,
but abandons his friend.</p>

<p>In a word, they invent and say the kind of thing that they
know will be most irritating to their hearer, and having a full
knowledge of his vulnerable point, concentrate their fire upon
it; he is to be too much flustered by rage to have time for investigation;
the very surprise of what he is told is to be so convincing
to him that he will not hear, even if his friend is willing
to plead.</p>

<p>That slander, indeed, is especially effective which is unwelcome;
Demetrius the Platonic was reported to Ptolemy Dionysus for
a water drinker, and for the only man who had declined to put
on female attire at the Dionysia. He was summoned next
morning, and had to drink in public, dress up in gauze, clash
and dance to the cymbals, or he would have been put to death
for disapproving the King's life, and setting up for a critic of
his luxurious ways.</p>

<p>At Alexander's court there was no more fatal imputation
than that of refusing worship and adoration to Hephaestion.
Alexander had been so fond of him that to appoint him a God
after his death was, for such a worker of marvels, nothing out
of the way. The various cities at once built temples to him,
holy ground was consecrated, altars, offerings and festivals
instituted to this new divinity; if a man would be believed, he
must swear by Hephaestion. For smiling at these proceedings,
or showing the slightest lack of reverence, the penalty was death.
The flatterers cherished, fanned, and put the bellows to this
childish fancy of Alexander's; they had visions and manifestations
of Hephaestion to relate; they invented cures and attributed
oracles to him; they did not stop short of doing sacrifice
to this God of Help and Protection. Alexander was delighted,
and ended by believing in it all; it gratified his vanity to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
that he was now not only a God's son, but a God-maker. It
would be interesting to know how many of his friends in those
days found that what the new divinity did for them was to
supply a charge of irreverence on which they might be dismissed
and deprived of the King's favour.</p>

<p>Agathocles of Samos was a valued officer of his, who very
narrowly escaped being thrown into a lion's cage; the offence
reported against him was shedding tears as he passed Hephaestion's
tomb. The tale goes that he was saved by Perdiccas,
who swore, by all the Gods and Hephaestion, that the God
had appeared plainly to him as he was hunting, and charged
him to bid Alexander spare Agathocles: his tears had meant
neither scepticism nor mourning, but been merely a tribute to
the friendship that was gone.</p>

<p>Flattery and slander had just then their opportunity in
Alexander's emotional condition. In a siege, the assailants do
not attempt a part of the defences that is high, precipitous, or
solid; they direct all their force at some rotten, low, or neglected
point, expecting to get in and effect the capture most easily so.
Similarly the slanderer finds out where the soul is weak or
corrupt or accessible, there makes his assault, there applies his
engines, or effects an entry at a point where there are no defenders
to mark his approach. Once in, he soon has all in flames; fire
and sword and devastation clear out the previous occupants;
how else should it be when a soul is captured and enslaved?</p>

<p>His siege-train includes deceit, falsehood, perjury, insinuation,
effrontery, and a thousand other moral laxities. But the chief
of them all is Flattery, the blood relation, the sister indeed, of
Slander. No heart so high, so fenced with adamant, but
Flattery will master it, with the aid of Slander undermining
and sapping its foundations.</p>

<p>That is what goes on outside. But within there are traitorous
parties working to the same end, stretching hands of help to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
attack, opening the gates, and doing their utmost to bring the
capture about. There are those ever-present human frailties,
fickleness and satiety; there is the appetite for the surprising.
We all delight, I cannot tell why, in whisperings and insinuations.
I know people whose ears are as agreeably titillated with
slander as their skin with a feather.</p>

<p>Supported by all these allies, the attack prevails; victory is
hardly in doubt for a moment; there is no defence or resistance
to the assault; the hearer surrenders without reluctance,
and the slandered knows nothing of what is going on; as when
a town is stormed by night, he has his throat cut in his sleep.</p>

<p>The most pitiful thing is when, all unconscious of how
matters stand, he comes to his friend with a cheerful countenance,
having nothing to be ashamed of, and talks and behaves
as usual, just as if the toils were not all round him. Then if
the other has any nobility or generous spirit of fair play in him,
he gives vent to his anger and pours out his soul; after which he
allows him to answer, and so finds out how he has been abused.</p>

<p>But if he is mean and ignoble, he receives him with a lip
smile, while he is gnashing his teeth in covert rage, wrathfully
brooding in the soul's dark depth, as the poet describes it.
I know nothing so characteristic of a warped slavish nature as
to bite the lip while you nurse your spite and cultivate your
secret hatred, one thing in your heart and another on your
tongue, playing with the gay looks of comedy a lamentable
sinister tragedy. This is especially apt to occur, when the
slander comes from one who is known for an old friend of the
slandered. When that is the case, a man pays no attention to
anything the victim or his apologists may say; that old friendship
affords a sufficient presumption of truth; he forgets that
estrangements, unknown to outsiders, constantly part the
greatest friends; and sometimes a man will try to escape the
consequences of his own faults by attributing similar ones to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
neighbour and getting his denunciation in first. It may be
taken, indeed, that no one will venture to slander an enemy;
that is too unconvincing; the motive is so obvious. It is the
supposed friend that is the most promising object, the idea
being to give your hearer absolute proof of your devotion to
him by sacrificing your dearest to his interests.</p>

<p>It must be added that there are persons who, if they subsequently
learn that they have condemned a friend in error, are
too much ashamed of that error to receive or look him in the
face again; you might suppose the discovery of his innocence
was a personal injury to them.</p>

<p>It is not, then, too much to say that life is made miserable
by these lightly and incuriously credited slanders. Antea said
to Proetus, after she had solicited and been scorned by Bellerophon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Die thou the death, if thou slay not the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so would have enforc'd my chastity!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the machinations of this lascivious woman, the young man
came near perishing in his combat with the Chimera, as the
penalty for continence and loyalty to his host. And Phaedra,
who made a similar charge against her stepson, succeeded in
bringing down upon Hippolytus a father's curse, though God
knows how innocent he was.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes,' I fancy some one objecting; 'but the traducer
sometimes deserves credit, being known for a just and a wise
man; then he ought to be listened to, as one incapable of
villany.' What? was there ever a juster man than Aristides?
yet he led the opposition to Themistocles and incited the people
against him, pricked by the same political ambition as he.
Aristides was a just man in all other relations; but he was
human, he had a gall, he was open to likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>And if the story of Palamedes is true, the wisest of the Greeks,
a great man in other respects too, stands convicted of hatching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that insidious plot<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; the ties that bind kinsmen, friends, and
comrades in danger, had to yield to jealousy. To be a man is
to be subject to this temptation.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to refer to Socrates, misrepresented to the
Athenians as an impious plotter, to Themistocles or Miltiades,
suspected after all their victories of betraying Greece; such
examples are innumerable, and most of them familiar.</p>

<p>What, then, should a man of sense do, when he finds one
friend's virtue pitted against another's truth? Why, surely,
learn from Homer's parable of the Sirens; he advises sailing
past these ear-charmers; we should stuff up our ears; we
should not open them freely to the prejudiced, but station
there a competent hall-porter in the shape of Judgement, who
shall inspect every vocal visitor, and take it on himself to admit
the worthy, but shut the door in the face of others. How
absurd to have such an official at our house door, and leave our
ears and understandings open to intrusion!</p>

<p>So, when any one comes to you with a tale, examine it on its
merits, regardless of the informant's age, general conduct, or
skill in speech. The more plausible he is, the greater need of
care. Never trust another's judgement&mdash;it may be in reality
only his dislike&mdash;but reserve the inquiry to yourself; let envy,
if such it was, recoil upon the backbiter, your trial of the two
men's characters be an open one, and your award of contempt
and approval deliberate. To award them earlier, carried away
by the first word of slander&mdash;why, God bless me, how puerile
and mean and iniquitous it all is!</p>

<p>And the cause of it, as we started with saying, is ignorance,
and the mystery that conceals men's characters. Would some
God unveil all lives to us, Slander would retire discomfited to
the bottomless pit; for the illumination of truth would be
over all.</p>

<h2>THE HALL</h2>


<p>As Alexander stood gazing at the transparent loveliness of the
Cydnus, the thought of a plunge into those generous depths,
of the delicious shock of ice-cold waters amid summer heat,
was too much for him; and could he have foreseen the illness
that was to result from it, I believe he would have had his bath
just the same. With such an example before him, can any one
whose pursuits are literary miss a chance of airing his eloquence
amid the glories of this spacious hall, wherein gold sheds all its
lustre, whose walls are decked with the flowers of art, whose
light is as the light of the sun? Shall he who might cause
this roof to ring with applause, and contribute his humble
share to the splendours of the place,&mdash;shall such a one content
himself with examining and admiring its beauties without a
word, and so depart, like one that is dumb, or silent from envy?
No man of taste or artistic sensibility, none but a dull ignorant
boor, would consent thus to cut himself off from the highest of
enjoyments, or could need to be reminded of the difference
between the ordinary spectator and the educated man. The
former, when he has carried his eyes around and upwards in
silent admiration, and clasped ecstatic hands, has done all that
can be expected of him; he ventures not on words, lest they
should prove inadequate to his subject. With the cultured
observer, it is otherwise: he, surely, will not rest content with
feasting his eyes on beauty; he will not stand speechless amid
his splendid surroundings, but will set his mind to work, and as
far as in him lies pay verbal tribute. Nor will his tribute consist
in mere praise of the building. It was well enough, no
doubt, for the islander Telemachus to express his boyish amazement
in the palace of Menelaus, and to liken that prince's gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and ivory to the glories of Heaven;&mdash;his limited experience
afforded him no earthly parallel: but here, the very use to
which the hall is put, and the distinguished quality of the
audience, are an essential part of the praise bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>Nothing, surely, could be more delightful than to find this
noble building thrown open for the reception of eloquent
praise, its atmosphere laden with panegyric, its very walls reechoing,
cavern-like, to every syllable, prolonging each cadence,
dwelling on each period;&mdash;nay, they are themselves an audience,
most appreciative of audiences, that stores up the speaker's
words in memory, and recompenses his efforts with a meed of
most harmonious flattery. Even so do the rocks resound to the
shepherd's flute; the notes come ringing back again, and simple
rustics think it is the voice of some maid, who dwells among the
crags, and from the depths of her rocky haunt makes answer to
their songs and their cries.</p>

<p>I feel as if a certain mental exaltation resulted from this
magnificence: it is suggestive; the imagination is stimulated.
It would scarcely be too much to say that through the medium
of the eyes Beauty is borne in upon the mind, and suffers no
thought to find utterance before it has received her impress.
We hold it for true that Achilles' wrath was whetted against
the Phrygians by the sight of his new armour, and that as he
donned it for the first time his lust of battle was uplifted on
wings: and why should not a beautiful building similarly be
a whet to the zeal of the orator? Luxuriant grass, a fine plane-tree
and a clear spring, hard by Ilissus, were inspiration enough
for Socrates: in such a spot he could sit bantering Phaedrus,
refuting Lysias, and invoking the Muses; never doubting&mdash;indelicate
old person&mdash;but that those virgin Goddesses would
grace his retirement with their presence, and take part in his
amorous discourse. But to such a place as this we may surely
hope that they will come uninvited. We can offer them something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
better than the shade of a plane-tree, though for that
upon Ilissus' bank we should substitute the golden one of the
Persian King. His tree had one claim to admiration&mdash;it was
expensive: but for symmetry and proportion and beautiful
workmanship, nothing of that kind was thrown in; the gold
was gold, an uncouth manifestation of solid wealth, calculated
to excite envy in the beholder, and to procure congratulations
for the possessor, but far from creditable to the artist.
The line of the Arsacidae cared nothing for beauty; they did
not appeal to men's taste; not <i>How may I win approval?</i> but
<i>How may I dazzle?</i> was the question they asked themselves.
The barbarian has a keen appreciation of gold: to the treasures
of art he is blind.</p>

<p>But I see about me in this Hall beauties that were never
designed to please barbarians, nor to gratify the vulgar ostentation
of Persian monarchs. Poverty is not here the sole requirement
of the critic: taste is also necessary; nor will the eyes
deliver judgement without the assistance of Reason. The
eastern aspect, procuring us, as in the temples of old, that first
welcome peep of the sun in his new-born glory, and suffering
his rays to pour in without stint through the open doors, the
adaptation of length to breadth and breadth to height, the free
admission of light at every stage of the Sun's course,&mdash;all is
charmingly contrived, and redounds to the credit of the architect.
What admirable judgement has been shown, too, in the
structure and decoration of the roof! nothing wanting, yet
nothing superfluous; the gilding is exactly what was required
to achieve elegance without empty display; it is precisely that
little touch of adornment with which a beautiful and modest
woman sets off her loveliness; it is the slender necklace about
her neck, the light ring upon her finger, the earrings, the brooch,
the fillet that imprisons her luxuriant hair, and, like the purple
stripe upon a robe, enhances its beauty. Contrast with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the artifices of courtesans, and particularly of the most unlovely
among them, whose robes are <i>all</i> of purple, and their necks loaded
with golden chains, who hope to render themselves attractive
by their extravagance, and by external adornments to supply
the deficiencies of Nature; their arms, they think, will look
more dazzlingly white if gold glitters upon them, a clumsy foot
pass unobserved if hidden in a golden sandal, and the face be
irresistible that appears beneath a halo of gold. The modest
house, far from resorting to such meretricious charms, uses as
little gold as may be; I think she knows that she would have
no cause to blush, though she should display her beauty stripped
of all adornment.</p>

<p>And so it is with this Hall. The roof&mdash;the head, as I may
say,&mdash;comely in itself, is not without its golden embellishments:
yet they are but as the stars, whose fires gleam here and there,
pranked in the darkness of the sky. Were that sky all fire, it
would be beautiful to us no longer, only terrible. Observe, too,
that the gold is not otiose, not merely an ornament among
ornaments, put there to flatter the eye: it diffuses soft radiance
from end to end of the building, and the walls are tinged with
its warm glow. Striking upon the gilded beams, and mingling
its brightness with theirs, the daylight glances down upon us
with a clearness and a richness not all its own. Such are the
glories overhead, whose praises might best be sung by him
who told of Helen's high-vaulted chamber, and Olympus'
dazzling peak.</p>

<p>And for the rest, the frescoed walls, with their exquisite
colouring, so clear, so highly finished, so true to nature, to what
can I compare them but to a flowery meadow in spring? Even
so the comparison halts. Those flowers wither and decay and
shed their beauty: but here is one eternal spring; this meadow
fades not, its flowers are everlasting; for no hand is put forth
to pluck away their sweetness, only the eye feeds thereon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
And what eye would not delight to feed on joys so varied?
What orator would not feel that his credit was at stake, and
be fired with ambition to surpass himself, rather than be found
wanting to his theme?</p>

<p>The contemplation of beautiful objects is of all things the
most inspiring, and not to men only. I think even a horse
must feel some increase of pleasure in galloping over smooth,
soft fields, that give an easy footing, and ring back no defiance
to his hoofs: it is then that he goes his best; the beauty of
his surroundings puts him on his mettle; he will not be beaten,
if pace counts for anything. And look at the peacock. Spring
has just begun; never are flowers a gladder sight than now;
it is as if they were really brighter, their hues more fresh, than
at other times. Watch the bird, as he struts forth into some
meadow: he spreads his feathers, and displays them to the Sun;
up goes his tail, a towered circle of flowery plumage; for with
him too it is spring, and the meadow challenges him to do his
utmost. See how he turns about, and shows forth his gorgeous
beauty. As the sun's rays strike upon him, the wonder grows:
there is a subtle transmutation of colours, one glory vanishing
and giving place to another. The change is nowhere more
apparent than in those rainbow rings at the ends of his feathers:
here a slight movement turns bronze to gold, and (such is the
potency of light) purple becomes green, because sun is exchanged
for shadow. As for the sea, I need not remind you how inviting,
how attractive, is its appearance on a calm day: the
veriest landlubber must long to be upon it, and sail far away
from the shore, as he marks how the light breeze fills the sails
and speeds the vessel on its gentle gliding course over the crests
of the waves.</p>

<p>The beauty of this Hall has a similar power over the orator,
encouraging him, stimulating him to fresh effort, enlarging his
ambition. The spell was irresistible: I have yielded to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
come hither to address you, as though drawn by wryneck's or by
Siren's charm; nor am I without hope that my words, bald
though they be in themselves, may yet borrow something from
that atmosphere of beauty in which they are here clothed as in
a garment.</p>

<p>Scarcely have I pronounced these last words, when a certain
Theory (and a very sound one, too, if we can take its own word
for it), which has been interrupting me all along, and doing its
best to break my speech off, informs me that there is no truth
in my statements, and expresses its surprise at my assertion that
gilding and mural decoration are favourable to the display of
rhetorical skill. The very contrary, it maintains, is the case.
On second thoughts, it may as well come forward and plead its
own cause; you, gentlemen, will kindly serve as jury, and hear
what it has to say in favour of the cheap and nasty in architecture,
considered as rhetorical conditions. My own sentiments
on this subject you have already heard, nor is there any occasion
for me to repeat them. The Theory is therefore at liberty to
speak; I will withdraw for a while, and hold my tongue.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen of the jury,' it begins, 'a splendid tribute has
been paid to this Hall by the last speaker; and I for my part
am so far from having any fault to find with the building, that
I propose to supply the deficiencies of his encomium; for by
magnifying its glories, I am so much the nearer to proving my
point, which is, its unsuitableness to the purposes of the orator.
And first I shall ask your permission to avail myself of his simile
of feminine adornments. In my opinion, it is not enough to
say that lavish ornament adds nothing to feminine beauty: it
actually takes away from it. Dazzled by gold and costly gems,
how should the beholder do justice to the charms of a clear
complexion, to neck, and eye, and arm, and finger? Sards
and emeralds, bracelets and necklaces, claim all his attention,
and the lady has the mortification of finding herself eclipsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by her own jewels, whose engrossed admirers can spare no
words, and barely a casual glance for herself. The same fate,
it seems to me, awaits the orator who exhibits his skill amid
these wondrous works of art: his praises are obscured, quite
swallowed up, in the splendour of the things he praises. It is
as if a man should bring a wax light to feed a mighty conflagration,
or set up an ant for exhibition on a camel's or an
elephant's back. That is one pitfall for the orator. And there
is another: the distracting influence of that resonant music
that echoes through the Hall, making voluminous answer to his
words, nay, drowning them in the utterance; surely as trumpet
quells flute, or the sea-roar the boatswain's pipe, if he presume
to contend with the crash of waves, so surely shall the orator's
puny voice be overmastered by this mighty music, and seem
like silence.</p>

<p>'Then again, my opponent spoke of the stimulating, the
encouraging effect produced on the speaker by architectural
beauty. I should have said that the effect was rather dispiriting
than otherwise: the speaker's thoughts are scattered, and
his confidence shaken, as he reflects on the disgrace that must
attach to mean words uttered beneath a noble roof. There
could be no more crushing ignominy; he is precisely in the
position of a warrior in brilliant armour who sets the example
of flight, and whose cowardice is only emphasized by his splendid
equipment. To this principle I should refer the conduct of
Homer's model orator, who, so far from attaching any importance
to externals, affected the bearing of a man that was altogether
witless; his design was to bring his eloquence into stronger
relief by the studied ungracefulness of his attitude.</p>

<p>'The orator's mind, too, is so engrossed with what he sees,
that it is absolutely impossible for him to preserve the thread
of his discourse; he cannot think of what he is saying, so imperatively
do the sights around him claim his attention. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
not to be expected that he will do himself justice: he is too
full of his subject. And I might add that his supposed hearers,
when they come into such a building as this, are no longer
hearers of <i>his</i> eloquence, but spectators of <i>its</i> beauties; he
must be a Thamyris, an Amphion, an Orpheus among orators
who could gain their attention in such circumstances. Once
let a man cross this threshold, and a blaze of beauty envelops
his senses; he is all eyes, and to the orator is "as one that
marketh not";&mdash;unless, indeed, he be altogether blind, or take
a hint from the court of Areopagus, and give audience in the
dark. Compare the story of the Sirens with that of the Gorgons,
if you would know how insignificant is the power of words in
comparison with that of visible objects. The enchantments of
the former were at the best a matter of time; they did but
flatter the ear with pleasing songs; if the mariner landed, he
remained long on their hands, and it has even happened to them
to be disregarded altogether. But the beauty of the Gorgons,
irresistible in might, won its way to the inmost soul, and wrought
amazement and dumbness in the beholder; admiration (so the
legend goes) turned him to stone. All that my opponent has
just said about the peacock illustrates my point: that bird
charms not the ear, but the eye. Take a swan, take a nightingale,
and set her singing: now put a silent peacock at her
side, and I will tell you which bird has the attention of the company.
The songstress may go hang now; so invincible a thing
is the pleasure of the eyes. Shall I call evidence? A sage,
then, shall be my witness, how far mightier are the things of
the eye than those of the ear. Usher, call me Herodotus, son
of Lyxes, of Halicarnassus.&mdash;Ah, since he has been so obliging
as to hear the summons, let him step into the box. You will
excuse the Ionic dialect; it is his way.'</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen of the jury, the Theory hath spoken sooth.
Give good heed to that he saith, how sight is a better thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
than hearing; for a man shall sooner trust his eyes than his
ears.</i></p>

<p>'You hear him, gentlemen? He gives the preference to
sight, and rightly. For words have wings; they are no sooner
out of the mouth than they take flight and are lost: but the
delight of the eyes is ever present, ever draws the beholder to
itself. Judge, then, the difficulty the orator must experience
in contending with such a rival as this Hall, whose beauty
attracts every eye.</p>

<p>'But my weightiest argument I have kept till now: you,
gentlemen, throughout the hearing of this case, have been
gazing with admiration on roof and wall, scanning each picture
in its turn. I do not reproach you: you have done what
every man must do, when he beholds workmanship so exquisite,
subjects so varied. Here are works whose perfect technique,
applied as it is to the illustration of all that is useful in history
and mythology, holds out an irresistible challenge to the judgement
of the connoisseur. Now I would not have your eyes
altogether glued to those walls; I would fain have some share
of your attention: let me try, therefore, to give you word-pictures
of these originals; I think it may not be uninteresting
to you to hear a description of those very objects which your
eyes view with such admiration. And you will perhaps count
it a point in my favour, that I, and not my antagonist, have hit
upon this means of doubling your pleasure. It is a hazardous
enterprise, I need not say,&mdash;without materials or models to put
together picture upon picture; this word-painting is but sketchy
work.</p>

<p>'On our right as we enter, we have a story half Argive, half
Ethiopian. Perseus slays the sea-monster, and sets Andromeda
free; it will not be long ere he leads her away as his bride; an
episode, this, in his Gorgon expedition. The artist has given
us much in a small space: maiden modesty, girlish terror, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
here portrayed in the countenance of Andromeda, who from
her high rock gazes down upon the strife, and marks the devoted
courage of her lover, the grim aspect of his bestial antagonist.
As that bristling horror approaches, with awful gaping jaws,
Perseus in his left hand displays the Gorgon's head, while his
right grasps the drawn sword. All of the monster that falls
beneath Medusa's eyes is stone already; and all of him that yet
lives the scimetar hews to pieces.</p>

<p>'In the next picture, a tale of retributive justice is dramatically
set forth. The painter seems to have taken his hint from
Euripides or Sophocles; each of them has portrayed this incident.
The two young men are friends: Pylades of Phocis,
and Orestes, who is thought to be dead. They have stolen
into the palace unobserved, and together they slay Aegisthus.
Clytemnestra has already been dispatched: her body lies, half-naked,
upon a bed; all the household stand aghast at the deed;
some cry out, others look about for means of escape. A fine
thought of the painter's: the matricide is but slightly indicated,
as a thing achieved: with the slaying of the paramour,
it is otherwise; there is something deliberate in the manner
in which the lads go about their work.</p>

<p>'Next comes a more tender scene. We behold a comely
God, and a beautiful boy. The boy is Branchus: sitting on
a rock, he holds out a hare to tease his dog, who is shown in the
act of jumping for it. Apollo looks on, well pleased: half of
his smile is for the dog's eagerness, and half for the mischievous
boy.</p>

<p>'Once more Perseus; an earlier adventure, this time. He
is cutting off Medusa's head, while Athene screens him from
her sight. Although the blow is struck, he has never seen his
handiwork, only the reflection of the head upon the shield;
he knows the price of a single glance at the reality.</p>

<p>'High upon the middle wall, facing the door, a shrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Athene is modelled. The statue of the Goddess is in white
marble. She is not shown in martial guise; it is the Goddess
of War in time of peace.</p>

<p>'We have seen Athene in marble: next we see her in painting.
She flies from the pursuit of amorous Hephaestus; it
was to this moment that Erichthonius owed his origin.</p>

<p>'The next picture deals with the ancient story of Orion. He
is blind, and on his shoulder carries Cedalion, who directs the
sightless eyes towards the East. The rising Sun heals his infirmity;
and there stands Hephaestus on Lemnos, watching
the cure.</p>

<p>'Then we have Odysseus, seeking by feigned madness to
avoid joining the expedition of the Atridae, whose messengers
have already appeared to summon him. Nothing could be
more convincing than his plough-chariot, his ill-assorted team,
and his apparent unconsciousness of all that is going forward.
But his paternal feeling betrays him. Palamedes, penetrating
his secret, seizes upon Telemachus, and threatens him with
drawn sword. If the other can act madness, <i>he</i> can act anger.
The father in Odysseus is revealed: he is frightened into sanity,
and throws aside the mask.</p>

<p>'Last of all is Medea, burning with jealousy, glaring askance
upon her children, and thinking dreadful thoughts. See, the
sword even now is in her hand: and there sit the victims,
smiling; they see the sword, yet have no thought of what is
to come.</p>

<p>'Need I say, gentlemen, how the sight of all these pictures
draws away the attention of the audience upon them, and
leaves the orator without a single hearer? If I have described
them at length, it was not in order to impress you with the
headstrong audacity of my opponent, in voluntarily thrusting
himself upon an audience so ill-disposed. I seek not to call
down your condemnation nor your resentment upon him, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
do I ask you to refuse him a hearing: rather I would have you
assist his endeavours, listen to him, if you can, with closed eyes,
and remember the difficulty of his undertaking; when you,
his judges, have become his fellow workers, he will still have
much ado to escape the imputation of bringing discredit upon
this magnificent Hall. And if it seem strange to you that
I should plead thus on my antagonist's behalf, you must attribute
it to my fondness for this same Hall, which makes me anxious
that every man who speaks in it should come off creditably, be
he who he may.'</p>

<h2>PATRIOTISM</h2>


<p>It is a truism with no pretensions to novelty that there is
nothing sweeter than one's country. Does that imply that,
though there is nothing pleasanter, there may be something
grander or more divine? Why, of all that men reckon grand
and divine their country is the source and teacher, originating,
developing, inculcating. For great and brilliant and splendidly
equipped cities many men have admiration, but for their own
all men have love. No man&mdash;not the most enthusiastic sightseer
that ever was&mdash;is so dazzled by foreign wonders as to forget
his own land.</p>

<p>He who boasts that he is a citizen of no mean city misses, it
seems to me, the true patriotism; he suggests that it would be
a mortification to him to belong to a State less distinguished.
It is country in the abstract that I delight rather to honour.
It is well enough when you are comparing States to investigate
the questions of size or beauty or markets; but when it is
a matter of choosing a country, no one would exchange his own
for one more glorious; he may wish that his own resembled
those more highly blest, but he will choose it, defects and all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the same with loyal sons, or good fathers. A young man
who has the right stuff in him will honour no man above his
father; nor will a father set his affections on some other young
man to the neglect of his son. On the contrary, fathers are so
convinced of their children's being better than they really are,
that they reckon them the handsomest, the tallest, the most
accomplished of their generation. Any one who does not judge
his offspring thus I cannot allow to have the father's eye.</p>

<p>The fatherland! it is the first and the nearest of all names.
It is true there is nothing nearer than a father; but a man who
duly honours his father, according to the dictates of law and
nature, will yet be right to honour his fatherland in still higher
degree; for that father himself belongs to the fatherland; so
does his father's father, and all his house back and back, till the
line ends with the Gods our fathers.</p>

<p>The Gods too love the lands of their nativity; though they
may be supposed to concern themselves with human affairs in
general, claiming the whole of earth and sea as theirs, yet each
of them honours above all other lands the one that gave him
birth. That State is more majestic which a God calls his
country, that isle has an added sanctity in which poesy affirms
that one was born. Those are acceptable offerings, which a
man has come to their respective homes to make. And if Gods
are patriotic, shall not men be more so?</p>

<p>For it was from his own country that every man looked his
first upon the Sun; that God, though he be common to all
men, yet each reckons among his country Gods, because in
that country he was revealed to him. There speech came to
him, the speech that belonged to that soil, and there he got
knowledge of the Gods. If his country be such that to attain
true culture he must seek another, yet even for that culture
let him thank his country; the word State he could never
have known, had not his country shown him that States existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>And surely men gather culture and learning, that they may
thereby render themselves more serviceable to their country;
they amass wealth that they may outdo their neighbours in
devoting it to their country's good. And 'tis no more than
reason; it is not for those who have received the greatest of all
benefits to prove thankless; if we are grateful, as we doubtless
should be, to the individual benefactor, much more ought we
to give our country her due; against neglect of parents the
various States have laws; we should account our country the
common mother of us all, and recompense her who bred us,
and taught us that there were laws.</p>

<p>The man was never known who so forgot his country as to
be indifferent to it when established in another State. All
who fare ill abroad are perpetually thinking how country is the
best of all good things; and those who fare well, whatever
their general prosperity, are ever conscious of the one thing
lacking: they do not live at home, but are exiles; and exile
is a reproach. Those again whose sojourn has brought them
distinction by way of garnered wealth or honourable fame,
acknowledged culture or approved courage, all of them, you
will find, yearn for their native land, where are the spectators
of their triumphs that they would most desire. A man's longing
for home is indeed in direct proportion to his credit
abroad.</p>

<p>Even the young have the patriotic sentiment; but in the
old it is as much more keen as their sense is greater. Every
old man directs his efforts and his prayers to ending his life in
his own land; where he began to live, there would he lay his
bones, in the soil that formed him, and join his fathers in the
grave. It is a dread fate to be condemned to exile even in
death, and lie in alien earth.</p>

<p>But if you would know the true man's feeling for his country,
it is in the born citizen that you must study it. The merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
naturalized are a sort of bastards ever ready for another change;
they know not nor love the name of country, but think they
may find what they need in one place as well as another; their
standard of happiness is the pleasures of the belly. Those
whose country is their true mother love the land whereon they
were born and bred, though it be narrow and rough and poor
of soil. If they cannot vaunt the goodness of the land, they
are still at no loss for praises of their country; if they see others
making much of bounteous plains and meadows variegated with
all plants that grow, they too can call up their country's praise;
another may breed good horses; what matter? theirs breeds
good men.</p>

<p>A man is fain to be at home, though the home be but an
islet; though he might have fortune among strangers, he will
not take immortality there; to be buried in his own land is
better. Brighter to him the smoke of home than the fire of
other lands.</p>

<p>In such honour everywhere is the name of country that you
will find legislators all the world over punishing the worst
offences with exile, as the heaviest penalty at their command.
And it is just the same with generals on service. When the
men are taking their places for battle, no such encouragement
as to tell them they are fighting for their country. No one
will disgrace himself after that if he can help it; the name of
country turns even a coward into a brave man.</p>

<h2>DIPSAS, THE THIRST-SNAKE</h2>


<p>The southern parts of Libya are all deep sand and parched
soil, a desert of wide extent that produces nothing, one vast
plain destitute of grass, herb, vegetation, and water; or if a
remnant of the scanty rain stands here and there in a hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
place, it is turbid and evil-smelling, undrinkable even in the
extremity of thirst. The land is consequently uninhabited;
savage, dried up, barren, droughty, how should it support life?
The mere temperature, an atmosphere that is rather fire than
air, and a haze of burning sand, make the district quite inaccessible.</p>

<p>On its borders dwell the Garamantians, a lightly clad, agile
tribe of tent-dwellers subsisting mainly by the chase. These
are the only people who occasionally penetrate the desert, in
pursuit of game. They wait till rain falls, about the winter
solstice, mitigating the excessive heat, moistening the sand, and
making it just passable. Their quarry consists chiefly of wild
asses, the giant ostrich that runs instead of flying, and monkeys,
to which the elephant is sometimes added; these are the only
creatures sufficiently proof against thirst and capable of bearing
that incessant fiery sunshine. But the Garamantians, as soon
as they have consumed the provisions they brought with them,
instantly hurry back, in fear of the sand's recovering its heat
and becoming difficult or impassable, in which case they would
be trapped, and lose their lives as well as their game. For if the
sun draws up the vapour, dries the ground rapidly, and has an
access of heat, throwing into its rays the fresh vigour derived
from that moisture which is its aliment, there is then no escape.</p>

<p>But all that I have yet mentioned, heat, thirst, desolation,
barrenness, you will count less formidable than what I now
come to, a sufficient reason in itself for avoiding that land. It
is beset by all sorts of reptiles, of huge size, in enormous numbers,
hideous and venomous beyond belief or cure. Some of them
have burrows in the sand, others live on the surface&mdash;toads,
asps, vipers, horned snakes and stinging beetles, lance-snakes,
reversible snakes<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, dragons, and two kinds of scorpion, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
great size and many joints that runs on the ground, the other
aerial, with gauzy wings like those of the locust, grasshopper, or
bat. With the multitude of flying things like these, that part
of Libya has no attraction for the traveller.</p>

<p>But the direst of all the reptiles bred in the sand is the dipsas
or thirst-snake; it is of no great size, and resembles the viper;
its bite is sharp, and the venom acts at once, inducing agonies
to which there is no relief. The flesh is burnt up and mortified,
the victims feel as if on fire, and yell like men at the stake.
But the most overpowering of their torments is that indicated
by the creature's name. They have an intolerable thirst; and
the remarkable thing is, the more they drink, the more they
want to drink, the appetite growing with what it feeds on.
You will never quench their thirst, though you give them all
the water in Nile or Danube; water will be fuel, as much as
if you tried to put out a fire with oil.</p>

<p>Doctors explain this by saying that the venom is originally
thick, and gains in activity when diluted with the drink,
becoming naturally more fluid and circulating more widely.</p>

<p>I have not seen a man in this condition, and I pray Heaven
I never may behold such human sufferings; I am happy to
say I have not set foot upon Libyan soil. But I have had an
epitaph repeated to me, which a friend assured me he had read
on the grave of a victim. My friend, going from Libya to
Egypt, had taken the only practicable land route by the Great
Syrtis. He there found a tomb on the beach at the sea's very
edge, with a pillar setting forth the manner of death. On it
a man was carved in the attitude familiar in pictures of Tantalus,
standing by a lake's side scooping up water to drink; the dipsas
was wound about his foot, in which its fangs were fastened,
while a number of women with jars were pouring water over
him. Hard by were lying eggs like those of the ostrich
hunted, as I mentioned, by the Garamantians. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
there was the epitaph, which it may be worth while to
give you:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See the envenom'd cravings Tantalus<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could find no thirst-assuaging charm to still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cask that daughter-brood of Danaus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For ever filling, might not ever fill.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are four more lines about the eggs, and how he was bitten
while taking them; but I forget how they go.</p>

<p>The neighbouring tribes, however, do collect and value these
eggs, and not only for food; they use the empty shells for vessels
and make cups of them; for, as there is nothing but sand for
material, they have no pottery. A particularly large egg is
a find; bisected, it furnishes two hats big enough for the
human head.</p>

<p>Accordingly the dipsas conceals himself near the eggs, and
when a man comes, crawls out and bites the unfortunate, who
then goes through the experiences just described, drinking and
increasing his thirst and getting no relief.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I have not told you all this to show you
I could do as well as the poet Nicander, nor yet by way of proof
that I have taken some trouble with the natural history of
Libyan reptiles; that would be more in the doctor's line, who
must know about such things with a view to treatment. No,
it is only that I am conscious (and now pray do not be offended
by my going to the reptiles for my illustration)&mdash;I am conscious
of the same feelings towards you as a dipsas victim has
towards drink; the more I have of your company, the more of
it I want; my thirst for it rages uncontrollably; I shall never
have enough of this drink. And no wonder; where else could
one find such clear sparkling water? You must pardon me,
then, if, bitten to the soul (most agreeably and wholesomely
bitten), I put my head under the fountain and gulp the liquor
down. My only prayer is that the stream that flows from you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
may never fail; never may your willingness to listen run dry
and leave me thirstily gaping! On my side there is no reason
why drinking should not go on for ever; the wise Plato says
that you cannot have too much of a good thing.</p>

<h2>A WORD WITH HESIOD</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Lycinus. Hesiod</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> As to your being a first-rate poet, Hesiod, we do not
doubt that, any more than we doubt your having received the
gift from the Muses, together with that laurel-branch; it is
sufficiently proved by the noble inspiration that breathes in
every line of your works. But there is one point on which we
may be excused for feeling some perplexity. You begin by
telling us that your divine gifts were bestowed upon you by
Heaven in order that you might sing of the glories that have
been, and tell of that which is to come. Well, now, one half
of your duties you have admirably performed. You have
traced back the genealogy of the Gods to Chaos and Ge and
Uranus and Eros; you have specified the feminine virtues;
and you have given advice to the farmer, adding complete information
with reference to the Pleiads, the seasons suitable
for ploughing, reaping, and sailing,&mdash;and I know not what
besides. But that far diviner gift, which would have been of
so much more practical utility to your readers, you do not
exercise at all: the soothsaying department is entirely overlooked.
We find no parallel in your poems to those prophetic
utterances which Calchas, and Telemus, and Polyidus, and
Phineus&mdash;persons less favoured by the Muses than yourself&mdash;were
wont to dispense freely to all applicants. Now in these
circumstances, you must plead guilty to one of three charges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Either the alleged promise of the Muses to disclose the future
to you <i>was</i> never given, and you are&mdash;excuse the expression&mdash;a
liar: or it was given, and fulfilled, but you, niggard, have
quietly pocketed the information, and refuse to impart it to
them that have need: or, thirdly, you <i>have</i> composed a number
of prophetic works, but have not yet given them to the world;
they are reserved for some more suitable occasion. I do not
presume to suggest, as a fourth possibility, that the Muses have
only fulfilled half of their promise, and revoked the other,&mdash;which,
observe, is recorded first in your poem. Now, if <i>you</i>
will not enlighten me on this subject, who can? As the Gods
are 'givers of good,' so you, their friends and pupils, should
impart your knowledge frankly, and set our doubts at rest.</p>

<p><i>Hes.</i> My poor friend, there is one very simple answer to all
your questions: I might tell you that not one of my poems is
my own work; all is the Muses', and to them I might refer you
for all that has been said and left unsaid. For what came of
my own knowledge, of pasturage, of milking, of driving afield,
and all that belongs to the herdsman's art, I may fairly be held
responsible: but for the Goddesses,&mdash;they give whatso they
will to whom they will.&mdash;Apart from this, however, I have the
usual poet's apology. The poet, I conceive, is not to be called
to account in this minute fashion, syllable by syllable. If in
the fervour of composition a word slip in unawares, search not
too narrowly; remember that with us metre and euphony have
much to answer for; and then there are certain amplifications&mdash;certain
elegances&mdash;that insinuate themselves into a verse, one
scarce knows how. Sir, you would rob us of our highest prerogative,
our freedom, our unfettered movement. Blind to
the flowers of poetry, you are intent upon its thorns, upon those
little flaws that give a handle to malicious criticism. But there!
you are not the only offender, nor I the only victim: in the
trivial defects of Homer, my fellow craftsman, many a carping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
spirit has found material for similar hair-splitting disquisitions.&mdash;Come,
now, I will meet my accuser on fair ground, face to
face. Read, fellow, in my <i>Works and Days</i>: mark the inspired
prophecies there set forth: the doom foretold to the negligent,
the success promised to him that labours aright and in due
season.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One basket shall suffice to store thy grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men shall not regard thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Could there be a more timely warning, balanced as it is by the
prospect of abundance held out to him that follows the true
method of agriculture?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Admirable; and spoken like a true herdsman. There is
no doubting the divine afflatus after that: left to yourself, you
cannot so much as defend your own poems. At the same time,
this is not quite the sort of thing we expect of Hesiod and the
Muses combined. You see, in this particular branch of prophecy,
you are quite outclassed by the farmers: they are
perfectly qualified to inform us that if the rain comes there
will be a heavy crop, and that a drought, on the other hand,
will inevitably be followed by scarcity; that midsummer is not
a good time to begin ploughing if you wish your seed to do
anything, and that you will find no grain in the ear if you reap
it when it is green. Nor do we want a prophet to tell us that
the sower must be followed by a labourer armed with a spade,
to cover up the seed; otherwise, the birds will come and consume
his prospective harvest. Call these useful suggestions, if
you like: but they are very far from my idea of prophecy. I
expect a prophet to penetrate into secrets wholly hidden from
our eyes: the prophet informs Minos that he will find his son
drowned in a jar of honey; he explains to the Achaeans the
cause of Apollo's resentment; he specifies the precise year in
which Troy will be captured. That <i>is</i> prophecy. But if the
term is to be so extended, then I shall be glad to have my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
claims recognized without loss of time. I undertake, without
the assistance of Castalian waters, laurel-branches, or Delphian
tripods, to foretell and prognosticate: <i>That if a man walk out
on a cold morning with nothing on, he will take a severe chill;
and particularly if it happens to be raining or hailing at the time</i>.
And I further prophesy: <i>That his chill will be accompanied by
the usual fever</i>; together with other circumstances which it
would be superfluous to mention.</p>

<p>No, Hesiod: your defence will not do; nor will your prophecies.
But I dare say there is something in what you said at
first&mdash;that you knew not what you wrote, by reason of the divine
afflatus versifying within you. And that afflatus was no such
great matter, either: afflatuses should not promise more than
they mean to perform.</p>

<h2>THE SHIP: OR, THE WISHES</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Lycinus. Timolaus. Samippus. Adimantus</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Said I not well? More easily shall a corpse lie mouldering
in the sun, and the vulture mark it not, than any strange
sight escape Timolaus, no matter though he must run all the
way to Corinth at a stretch for it.&mdash;Indefatigable sightseer!</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> Well, Lycinus, what do you expect? One has nothing
to do, and just then one hears that a great monster of an Egyptian
corn-ship has put in to Piraeus. What is more, I believe you
and Samippus came down on precisely the same errand.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> So we did, so we did, and Adimantus with us; only he
has got lost somewhere in the crowd of spectators. We came
all together to the ship; and going on board you were in
front, Samippus, if I remember, and Adimantus next, and I
was behind, hanging on to him for dear life; he gave me a hand
all up the gangway, because I had never taken my shoes off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
he had; but I saw no more of him after that, either on board
or when we came ashore.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> You see when it was we lost him, Lycinus? It must
have been when that nice-looking boy came up from the hold,
you know, with the beautiful clean linen, and his hair parted
in the middle and done up in a knot behind. If I know anything
of Adimantus, he no sooner saw that charming sight, than
he said good-bye to the Egyptian ship-wright who was showing
us round; and now stands urging his tearful suit. You know
his way; tears come natural to him in these affairs of the heart.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, but, Samippus, this boy was nothing great, that
he should make such a conquest; Adimantus has the beauties
of Athens at his beck; nice gentlemanly boys, with good Greek
on their tongues, and the mark of the gymnasium on every
muscle; a man may languish under <i>their</i> rigours with some
credit. As for this fellow, to say nothing of his dark skin, and
protruding lips, and spindle shanks, his words came tumbling
out in a heap, one on the top of another; it was Greek, of course,
but the voice, the accent were Egyptian born. And then his
hair: no freeman ever had his hair tied up in a knot behind
like that.</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> Oh, but that is a sign of noble birth in Egypt, Lycinus.
All gentlemen's sons wear their hair done up till they reach
manhood. It was the other way with our ancestors: the topknot,
and the golden grasshopper to keep it together, were the
proper thing for old men in their time.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Very much to the point, Timolaus; you allude to the
remarks in Thucydides's preface, about our old luxurious habits,
as preserved in the Asiatic colonies.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Of course! I remember now where it was we lost
Adimantus. It was when we were standing all that time looking
up at the mast, counting the layers of hides, and watching
that marvellous fellow going up the shrouds, and running along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the yards, perfectly comfortable, with just a hand on the yard-tackling.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> So it was. Well, now what are we to do? Shall we
wait for him here, or do you think I had better go back on
board?</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> No, no, let us walk on; he has probably gone tearing
off home, not being able to find us. Anyhow, he knows the
way; he will never get lost for want of us to take care of him.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> It is rather a shame, perhaps, to go off and leave one's
friend to shift for himself. However, I agree, if Samippus
does.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Certainly I do. We may find the gymnasium open still.&mdash;I
say, though, what a size that ship was! 180 feet long,
the man said, and something over a quarter of that in width;
and from deck to keel, the maximum depth, through the hold,
44 feet. And then the height of the mast, with its huge yard;
and what a forestay it takes to hold it! And the lofty stern
with its gradual curve, and its gilded beak, balanced at the other
end by the long rising sweep of the prow, and the figures of
her name-goddess, Isis, on either side. As to the other ornamental
details, the paintings and the scarlet topsail, I was more
struck by the anchors, and the capstans and windlasses, and the
stern cabins. The crew was like a small army. And they were
saying she carried as much corn as would feed every soul in
Attica for a year. And all depends for its safety on one little
old atomy of a man, who controls that great rudder with a mere
broomstick of a tiller! He was pointed out to me; Heron
was his name, I think; a woolly-pated fellow, half-bald.</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> He is a wonderful hand at it, so the crew say; a very
Proteus in sea-cunning. Did they tell you how he brought
them here, and all their adventures? how they were saved by
a star?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No; you can tell us about that now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> I had it from the master, a nice intelligent fellow to talk
to. They set sail with a moderate wind from Pharus, and
sighted Acamas on the seventh day. Then a west wind got
up, and they were carried as far east as Sidon. On their way
thence they came in for a heavy gale, and the tenth day brought
them through the Straits to the Chelidon Isles; and there they
very nearly went to the bottom. I have sailed past the Chelidons
myself, and I know the sort of seas you get there, especially
if the wind is SW. by S.; it is just there, of course, that the
division takes place between the Lycian and Pamphylian waters;
and the surge caused by the numerous currents gets broken at
the headland, whose rocks have been sharpened by the action
of the water till they are like razors; the result is a stupendous
crash of waters, the waves often rising to the very top of the
crags. This was the kind of thing they found themselves in
for, according to the master,&mdash;and on a pitch dark night! However,
the Gods were moved by their distress, and showed them
a fire that enabled them to identify the Lycian coast; and
a bright star&mdash;either Castor or Pollux&mdash;appeared at the masthead,
and guided the ship into the open sea on their left; just
in time, for she was making straight for the cliff. Having once
lost their proper course, they sailed on through the Aegean,
bearing up against the Etesian winds, until they came to anchor
in Piraeus yesterday, being the seventieth day of the voyage;
you see how far they had been carried out of their way; whereas
if they had taken Crete on their right, they would have doubled
Malea, and been at Rome by this time.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> A pretty pilot this Heron, and no mistake, to get so far
out in his reckoning; a man after Nereus's heart!&mdash;But look!
that is surely Adimantus?</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> Adimantus it is. Let us hail him. Adimantus!... Son
of Strombichus!... of the deme of Myrrhinus! He must be
offended with us, or else he is deaf; it is certainly he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I can make him out quite clearly now; his cloak, his
walk, his cropped head. Let us mend our pace, and catch
him up.&mdash;We shall have to pull you by the cloak, and compel
you to turn round, Adimantus; you will take no notice of our
shouts. You seem like one rapt in contemplation; you are
pondering on matters of no light import?</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Oh, it is nothing serious. An idle fancy, that came to
me as I walked, and engrossed my attention, so that I never
heard you.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> And the fancy? Tell us without reserve, unless it is
a very delicate matter. And even if it is, you know, we have
all been through the Mysteries; we can keep a secret.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> No, I had rather not tell you; you would think it so
childish.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Can it be a love affair? Speak on; <i>those</i> mysteries too
are not unknown to us; we have been initiated in full torchlight.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Oh dear, no; nothing of that kind.&mdash;No; I was making
myself an imaginary present of a fortune&mdash;that 'vain, deluding
joy,' as it has been called; I had just reached the pinnacle of
luxury and affluence when you arrived.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Then all I have to say is, 'Halves!' Come, out with
your wealth! We are Adimantus's friends: let us share his
superfluities.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Well, I lost sight of you at once on the ship&mdash;the moment
I had got you safely up, Lycinus. I was measuring the thickness
of the anchor, and you disappeared somewhere. However, I
went on and saw everything, and then I asked one of the sailors
how much the vessel brought in to her owner in an average year.
Three thousand pounds, he said, was the lowest reckoning. So
afterwards, on the way back, I was thinking: Suppose some
God took it into his head to make <i>me</i> a present of that ship;
what a glorious life I should have of it, and my friends too!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Sometimes I could make the trip myself, at other times I could
send my men. On the strength of that three thousand, I had
already built myself a house, nicely situated just above the
Poecile&mdash;I would have nothing more to say to my ancestral
abode on the banks of the Ilissus,&mdash;and was in treaty for my
wardrobe and slaves and chariots and stable. And now behold
me on board, the envy of every passenger, and the terror of my
crew, who regarded me as next thing to a king; I was getting
matters shipshape, and taking a last look at the port in the
distance, when up comes Lycinus, capsizes the vessel, just as
she is scudding before a wishing wind, and sends all my wealth
to the bottom.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, you are a man of spirit: lay hands on me, and
away with me to the governor, for the buccaneer that I am.
A flagrant case of piracy; on the high roads, too, between
Athens and Piraeus. Stay, though; perhaps we can compound
the matter. What do you say to <i>five</i> ships, larger and finer ones
than your Egyptian; above all, warranted not to sink?&mdash;each
to bring you, shall we say, five cargoes of corn per annum?
Though I foresee that you will be the most unbearable of shipowners
when you have got them. The possession of this one
made you deaf to our salutations; give you five more&mdash;three-masters
all of them, and imperishable&mdash;and the result is obvious:
you will not know your friends when you see them. And so,
good voyage to your worship; we will establish ourselves at
Piraeus, and question all who land from Egypt or Italy, as to
whether they came across Adimantus's great ship, the Isis,
anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> There now; that was why I refused to tell you about it
at first; I knew you would make a jest and a laughing-stock of
my Wish. So now I shall stop here till you have got on ahead,
and then I shall go another voyage on my ship. I like talking
to my sailors much better than being jeered at by you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> That will never do. We shall hang about, and go on
board too.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> I shall go on first, and haul up the gangway.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Then we shall swim across and board you. You seem
to think there will be no difficulty about your acquiring these
great ships without building them or paying for them;
why should not <i>we</i> obtain from the Gods the privilege of
swimming for an indefinite distance without getting tired?
You made no objection to our company the other day, you
know, when we all went across together to Aegina, to see the
rites of Hecate, in that tiny little boat, at sixpence a head;
and now you are furious at the idea of our going on board with
you; you go on ahead, and haul up the gangway. You forget
yourself, my Shipowner; you wax fat and kick; you withhold
from Nemesis her due. See what comes of houses in fashionable
quarters, and great retinues. Well, please remember to
bring us back some of those exquisite smoked fish from the Nile,
or some myrrh from Canopus, or an ibis from Memphis;&mdash;I
suppose you would scarcely have room for a pyramid?</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> That is enough, Lycinus. Spare his blushes. You have
quite swamped his ship; she is laughter-logged, and can weather
it no longer. Now, we have still some distance before us; let
us break it up into four parts, and each have so many furlongs,
in which he may demand of the Gods what he will. This will
lighten our journey, and amuse us into the bargain; we shall
revel in a delightful waking dream of unlimited prosperity; for
each of us will have full control of his own Wish, and it will be
understood that the Gods must grant everything, however
impracticable. Above all, it will give us an idea who would
make the best use of the supposed wealth; we shall see what
kind of a man it would have made of him.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> A good idea. I am your man; I undertake to wish
when my turn comes. We need not ask Adimantus whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he agrees; he has one foot on board already. We must have
Lycinus's sanction, however.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, let us to our wealth, if so it must be. Where all
is prosperity, I would not be thought to cast an evil eye.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Who begins?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> You; and then Samippus, and then Timolaus. I shall
only want the last hundred yards or so before the Gate for mine,
and a quick hundred, too.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Well, I stick to my ship still; only I shall wish some
more things, as it is allowed. May the God of Luck say Yes
to all! I will have the ship, and everything in her; the cargo,
the merchants, the women, the sailors, and anything else that
is particularly nice to have.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> You forget one thing you have on board&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Oh, the boy with the hair; yes, him too. And instead
of the present cargo of wheat, I will have the same bulk of
coined gold, all sovereigns.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Hullo! The ship will sink. Wheat and gold to the
same bulk are not of the same weight.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Now, don't make envious remarks. When your turn
comes, you can have the whole of Parnes turned into a mass of
gold if you like, and I shall say nothing.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh, I was only thinking of your safety. I don't want
all hands to go down with the golden cargo. It would not
matter so much about us, but the poor boy would be drowned;
he can't swim.</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> Oh, that will be all right. The dolphins will pick him
up and get him to shore. Shall a paltry musician be rescued
by them for a song's sake, a lifeless Melicertes be carried on their
backs to the Isthmus, and Adimantus's latest purchase find
never an amorous dolphin at his need?</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Timolaus, you are just as bad as Lycinus, with your superfluous
sneers. You ought to know better; it was all your idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> You should make it more plausible. Find a treasure
under your bed; that would save unloading the gold, and
getting it up to town.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Oh yes! It shall be dug up from under the Hermes in
our court; a thousand bushels of coined gold. Well; my first
thought has been for a handsome house,&mdash;'the homestead first
and chiefest,' says Hesiod; and my purchases in the neighbourhood
are now complete; there remains my property at Delphi,
and the sea-front at Eleusis; and a little something at the
Isthmus (I might want to stop there for the games); and the
plain of Sicyon; and in short every scrap of land in the country
where there is nice shade, or a good stream, or fine fruit; I
reserve them all. We will eat off gold plate; and our cups
shall weigh 100 lb. apiece; I will have none of the flimsy ware
that appears on Echecrates's table.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I dare say! And how is your cupbearer going to hand
you a thing of that weight, when he has filled it? And how
will you like taking it from him? It would tax the muscles of
a Sisyphus, let alone a cupbearer's.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Oh, don't keep on picking holes in my Wish. I shall
have tables and couches of solid gold, if I like; and servants
too, if you say another word.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, take care, or you will be like Midas, with nothing
but gold to eat and drink; and die of a right royal hunger,
a martyr to superabundance.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Your turn will come presently, Lycinus, and then you
can be as realistic as you like. To proceed: I must have purple
raiment, and every luxury, and sleep as late as I like; with
friends to come and pay court to me, and every one bowing
down to the ground; and they will all have to wait about at
my doors from early morning&mdash;the great Cleaenetus and Democritus
among them; oh yes, and when they come and try to
get in before every one else, seven great foreign giants of porters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
shall slam the door in their faces, just as theirs do now. And
as soon as I feel inclined, I shall peep out like the rising sun,
and some of that set I shall simply ignore; but if there is some
poor man there, like me before I got the treasure, I shall have
a kind word for him: 'You must come and have dinner with
me, after your bath; you know my hour.' The great men will
all choke with envy when they see my chariots and horses, and
my handsome slaves&mdash;two thousand choice ones, of all ages.
Well, so the dinner service is to be of gold,&mdash;no silver for me,
it is much too cheap&mdash;and I shall have smoked fish from Spain;
wine from Italy; oil from Spain again; our own honey, but it
must be clarified without heat; delicacies from all quarters;
wild boars; hares; all sorts of birds, pheasants, Indian peacocks,
Numidian capons; and special cooks for everything,
artists in sauce and seasoning. And when I call for a beaker
or goblet to pledge any one, he shall take it home with him.
As to the people who now pass for rich, they, I need not say,
will be paupers to me. Dionicus will give up displaying his
silver plate and cup in processions, when he sees that my slaves
eat off nothing but silver. I should set apart something for the
public service, too; a monthly distribution of &pound;4 a head to
citizens, and half that to foreigners; and the most beautiful
theatres and baths you can imagine; and the sea should be
brought along a great canal up to the Double Gates, and there
would be a harbour close by, so that my ship could be seen
lying at anchor from the Ceramicus. And of you who are my
friends, Samippus should have twenty bushels of coined gold
paid out to him by my steward; Timolaus, five quarts; and
Lycinus one quart, strict measure, because he talks too much,
and sneers at my Wish. That is how I would live; revelling
in every luxury without stint, superlatively rich. I have done.
Hermes bring it all to pass!</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Have you realized on what a slender thread all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
wealth depends? Once let that break, and all is gone; your
treasure is but dust and ashes.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, it is not clear how long this life of affluence is to
last. Who knows? You may be sitting one day at your solid
gold table, just putting out your hand for a slice of that peacock
or capon, when, at that very moment, off flies <i>animula vagula</i>,
and Adimantus after her, leaving his all a prey to crows and
vultures. Need I enumerate instances? There have been rich
men who have died before they knew what it was to be rich;
others have lived to be robbed of their possessions by some
malign spirit who waits upon wealth. The cases of Croesus and
Polycrates are familiar to you. Their riches were greater far
than yours; yet at one stroke they lost all. But leaving them
out of the case, do you consider that you have good security
for the continuance of your health? Look at the number of
rich men whose lives are made miserable by their infirmities:
some are crippled, others are blind, others have internal diseases.
Say what you will, I am sure that for double your wealth you
would not consent to be a weakling like rich Phanomachus;
not to mention the artful designs, the robberies, the envy, and
the unpopularity that are inseparable from wealth. See what
troubles your treasure will land you in!</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> You are always against me, Lycinus. I shall cancel your
quart now, for this last piece of spite.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> That is so like a rich man, to draw back and break his
promise; a good beginning! Now, Samippus, it is your turn
to wish.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Well, I am a landsman; I come from Mantinea, you
know, in Arcadia; so I shall not ask for a ship; I could make
no show with that in my country. Nor will I insult the generosity
of the Gods by asking for so much gold down. I understand
there is no boon so great, but their power and Timolaus's law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
can compass it; we are to wish away without ceremony, he
says,&mdash;they will refuse us nothing. Well then, I wish to be
a king. But I will not succeed to a hereditary throne, like
Alexander of Macedon, Ptolemy, Mithridates and the rest of
them. No, I will begin as a brigand, in a troop of thirty or so,
brisk companions ready at need. Then little by little we shall
grow to be 300; then 1,000, and presently 10,000; and at last
we shall total 50,000 heavy-armed, and 5,000 horse. I shall be
elected their chieftain by general consent, having shown myself
to be the best qualified for the command and conduct of their
affairs. Already, you see, I have the advantage of ordinary
kings: I am elected to the command on my own merits; I am
no hereditary monarch, reaping the fruits of my predecessor's
labours. That would be like Adimantus, with his treasure;
but there is much more satisfaction in knowing that your power
is the work of your own hands.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Now really, this <i>is</i> a Wish, and no mistake; the very
acme of blessedness; to be commander of that vast company,
chosen on your own merits by 50,000 men! A genius, a master
of strategy and king-craft has been quietly growing up in Mantinea,
and we not a whit the wiser! But I interrupt. Proceed,
O King, at the head of your troops; dispose your forces, infantry
and cavalry. Whither, I wonder, goes this mighty host,
issuing from Arcadia? Who are to be the first victims?</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> I'll tell you; or you can come with us, if you like. I will
put you in command of the cavalry.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, as to that, your Majesty, I am much beholden to
you for the honour; accept my most oriental prostrations;
and manuflexions. But, with all respect to your diadem, and
the perpendicularity of your tiara, you would do well to take
one of these stout fellows instead. I am sadly deficient in
horsemanship; indeed, I was never on a horse in my life. I
am afraid that when the trumpet sounded to advance, I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fall off, and be trampled, in the general confusion, under some
of those numerous hoofs. Or again, my spirited charger might
get the bit between his teeth, and carry me right into the midst
of the enemy. If I am to remain in possession of saddle and
bridle, I shall have to be tied on.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> All right, Samippus, I will command the cavalry;
Lycinus can have the right wing. I have the first claim on
you, after all those bushels of sovereigns.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Let us see what my troopers think of you for a leader.
All in favour of Adimantus, hold up their hands.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> All hands go up, look.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> You command the cavalry, then, and Lycinus the right
wing. Timolaus will have the left wing. I am in the centre,
like the Persian monarchs when they take the field in person.
Well; after due observance paid to Zeus, king of kings, we advance
along the hill-road to Corinth. Greece being now subjugated
(for no resistance will be offered to our enormous host,
we shall merely walk over), we get our troops on to the galleys,
and the horses on to the transports (arrangements having been
made at Cenchreae for the requisite number of vessels, with
adequate provision and so on), cross the Aegean, and land in
Ionia. Here we sacrifice to Artemis, and finding the various
cities unfortified, take easy possession of them, put in governors,
and march on in the direction of Syria. On the way we pass
through Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Pisidia, the mountains and
sea-board of Cilicia, and so at last reach the Euphrates.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> If your Majesty has no objection, I will stay behind and
be Pacha of Greece. I am a poor-spirited fellow; to go all
that way from home is not to my liking at all. You evidently
meditate an attack upon the Parthians and Armenians, warlike
folk, and unerring shots. Let some one else have the right
wing, and let me play Antipater here at home. Some arrow,
from the walls of Susa or Bactra, might find a chink in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
armour, and let daylight through me; and there would be
a melancholy end of my strategic career.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Oh coward, to desert your post! The penalty for that
is decapitation.&mdash;We are now at the Euphrates, and have thrown
our bridge across. All is secured in our rear by the subordinates
whom I have placed in charge of the various districts; officers
have also been dispatched for the reduction of Phoenicia and
Palestine, and, subsequently, of Egypt. Now, Lycinus, you
cross first, with the right wing; I next, and Timolaus after me.
Last comes Adimantus with the cavalry. We have now crossed
Mesopotamia, and no enemy has yet shown himself; town
after town has voluntarily given itself up; we reach Babylon;
we enter its gates without warning, and the city is ours. The
Persian king meanwhile is at Ctesiphon. He hears of our approach
and withdraws to Seleucia, where he proceeds to muster
his full strength of cavalry, bowmen, and slingers. Our scouts
report that the force already collected numbers something like
a million, including two hundred thousand mounted bowmen;
and the Armenian, Caspian, and Bactrian contingents are still
to come; only the neighbouring districts, the suburbs, as it
were, of the empire, have contributed as yet. With such ease
does the Persian monarch raise a million of men! It is now
time for us to think what we are to do next.</p>

<p><i>Ad.</i> Well, I say that you should all march for Ctesiphon,
leaving me to secure Babylon with the cavalry.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Are you going to show the white feather too, Adimantus,
now that the danger is near?&mdash;Timolaus, what is your
advice?</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> We must march upon the enemy in full force, before
they have had time to strengthen their hands with the reinforcements
that are pouring in from all quarters; let us
engage them whilst they are still making their several ways to
Seleucia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> There is something in that. What do you recommend,
Lycinus?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, we have all been on our legs till we are tired out;
there was the early walk down, and we must be a good three
miles now on the way home; and the sun is extremely powerful&mdash;it
is just about noon: how would it be to sit down for
a bit on that ruined column under the olive trees, till we are
sufficiently restored to complete the journey?</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> <i>O sancta simplicitas!</i> Did you think that you were at
Athens all this time? You are in the plain before Babylon,
in a great camp,&mdash;engaged in a council of war.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, so I am. I forgot; we are drunk, of course; it is
against rules to talk sense.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Well, now, please, to the attack. Bear yourselves gallantly
in this hour of danger: be not less than Greeks. See, the
enemy are upon us. Our watchword is 'Lord of Battles.'
The moment the trumpet sounds, raise the war-cry, clash
spear upon shield, and lose no time in coming to close quarters,
out of danger of their arrows; otherwise the bowmen will give
us a warm reception. No sooner do we get to work than Timolaus
with his left wing routs their right; in the centre the conflict
is even; for I have the native Persian troops against me,
and the king is in their midst. The whole strength of their
cavalry bears down upon our right wing; play the man, therefore,
Lycinus; and encourage your troops to receive the
charge.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Just my luck! Every single trooper of them is making
straight for me, as if I were the only foeman worthy of their
steel. If they go on like this, I think I shall have to turn tail
and make for the gymnasium, and leave you to fight it out.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Nonsense; you have almost beaten them already. Now,
observe, the king challenges me to single combat; honour forbids
that I should draw back; I accordingly engage him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> To be sure; and are promptly wounded. No king
should omit to receive a wound, when empire is at stake.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Well, yes; I do get just a scratch; it is well out of sight,
however, so the scar will be no disfigurement. On the other
hand, observe the fury of my charge: I send my spear through
horse and rider at one stroke; cut off the royal head; remove
the diadem therefrom, and am saluted as king with universal
prostrations. That applies only to the barbarians; from you
who are Greeks I shall have merely the usual title of commander-in-chief.
You may imagine the rest: the Samippopolises I shall
found, the cities I shall storm and destroy for slighting my
supremacy. The wealthy Cydias will come in for the largest
share of my attention; I have not forgotten his gradual encroachments
on my property, in the days when we were neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Stop there, Samippus; after such a victory, it is high
time you retired to Babylon, to keep festival. Three-quarters
of a mile is your allowance of dominion, as I reckon it. Timolaus
now selects his wish.</p>

<p><i>Sa.</i> Well, tell me what you think of mine?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> It seems to me, most sapient monarch, to involve considerably
more trouble and annoyance than that of Adimantus.
While he lives luxuriously, and hands about gold cups&mdash;hundred-pounders&mdash;to
his guests, you are sustaining wounds in single
combat. From morning till night, all is worry and anxiety
with you. You have not only the public enemies to fear: there
are the numberless conspiracies, the envy and hatred of your
courtiers; you have flatterers enough, but not one friend; their
seeming goodwill is the work of fear or ambition. As to enjoyment,
you can never dream of such a thing. You have to content
yourself with glory and gold embroidery and purple;
with the victor's garland, and the king's bodyguard; beyond
these there is nothing but intolerable toil and continual dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>comfort.
You are either negotiating with ambassadors, or
judging cases, or issuing mandates to your subjects. Here a
tribe revolts: there an enemy invades. All is fear and suspicion.
The world may think you happy; but you know better.
And surely it is a very humiliating circumstance that you should
be apt to fall ill, just like ordinary people? Fevers seem not to
understand that you are a king; nor does Death stand in any
awe of your bodyguard; when the fancy takes him, he comes,
and carries you off lamenting; what cares he for the diadem?
Fallen from your high estate, dragged from your kingly throne,
you go the same road as the rest of us; there is no 'benefit of
royalty' among the timid flock of shades. You leave behind
you upon earth some massive tomb, some stately column, some
pyramid of noble outline; but it will be too late then for vanity
to enjoy these things; and the statues and temples, the offerings
of obsequious cities, nay, your great name itself, all will
presently decay, and vanish, and be of no further account.
Take it at the best; let all endure for ages: what will it profit
your senseless clay? And it is for this that you are to live
uneasy days, ever scheming, fearing, toiling!&mdash;Timolaus, the
wish is with you. We shall expect better things from your
judgement and experience.</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> See if you can find anything questionable or reprehensible
in what I propose. As to treasure-heaps and bushels of coin,
I will have none of them; nor monarchy, with the wars and
terrors it involves. You rightly censured such things, precarious
as they are, exposed to endless machinations, and bringing
with them more vexation than pleasure. No; my wish is
that Hermes should appear and present me with certain rings,
possessed of certain powers. One should ensure its wearer
continual health and strength, invulnerability, insensibility to
pain. Another, like that of Gyges, should make me invisible.
A third should give me the strength to pick up with ease a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
weight that ten thousand men could barely move. Then
I must be able to fly to any height above the earth; a ring for
that. Again, I shall want to be able to put people to sleep
upon occasion; and at my approach all doors must immediately
fly open, all bolts yield, all bars withdraw. One ring may
secure these points. There remains yet one, the most precious
of them all; for with it on my finger I am the desire of every
woman and boy, ay, of whole nations; not one escapes me;
I am in all hearts, on all tongues. Women will hang themselves
for the vehemence of their passion, boys will go mad.
Happy will those few be reckoned on whom I cast a glance;
and those whom I scorn will pine away for grief. Hyacinth,
Hylas, Phaon, will sink into insignificance beside me. And all
this I hold on no brief tenure; the limitations of human life
are not for me. I shall live a thousand years, ever renewing my
youth, and casting off the slough of old age every time I get to
seventeen.&mdash;With these rings I shall lack nothing. All that is
another's is mine: for can I not open his doors, put his guards
to sleep, and walk in unperceived? Instead of sending to
India or to the Hyperboreans for their curiosities, their treasures,
their wines or their delicacies, I can fly thither myself, and take
my fill of all. The phoenix of India, the griffin, that winged
monster, are sights unknown to others: I shall see them. I
alone shall know the sources of the Nile, the lands that are
uninhabited, the Antipodes, if such there be, dwelling on the
other side of the earth. Nay, I may learn the nature of the
stars, the moon, the sun itself; for fire cannot harm me. And
think of the joy of announcing the Olympian victor's name in
Babylon, on the day of the contest! or of having one's breakfast
in Syria, and one's dinner in Italy! Had I an enemy,
I could be even with him, thanks to my invisibility, by cracking
his skull with a rock; my friends, on the other hand, I might
subsidize with showers of gold as they lay asleep. Have we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
some overweening tyrant, who insults us with his wealth? I
carry him off a couple of miles or so, and drop him over the
nearest precipice. I could enjoy the company of my beloved
without let or hindrance, going secretly in after I had put
every one else in the house to sleep. What a thing it would
be to hover overhead, out of range, and watch contending
armies! If I liked, I could take the part of the vanquished,
send their conquerors to sleep, rally the fugitives and give them
the victory. In short, the affairs of humanity would be my
diversion; all things would be in my power; mankind would
account me a God. Here is the perfection of happiness, secure
and indestructible, backed as it is by health and longevity.
What faults have you to find, Lycinus?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> None; it is not safe to thwart a man who has wings, and
the strength of ten thousand. I have only one question to ask.
Did you ever, among all the nations you passed in your flight,
meet with a similar case of mental aberration? a man of mature
years riding about on a finger-ring, moving whole mountains
with a touch; bald and snub-nosed, yet the desire of all
eyes? Ah, there was another point. What is to prevent one
single ring from doing all the work? Why go about with your
left hand loaded,&mdash;a ring to every finger? nay, they overflow;
the right hand must be forced into the service. And you have
left out the most important ring of all, the one to stop your
drivelling at this absurd rate. Perhaps you consider that a
stiffish dose of hellebore would serve the turn?</p>

<p><i>Ti.</i> Now, positively, Lycinus, you must have a try yourself.
You find fault with everybody else; this time we should like to
hear <i>your</i> version of a really unexceptionable wish.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> What do I want with a wish? Here we are at the gates.
What with the valiant Samippus's single combat at Babylon,
and your breakfasts in Syria and dinners in Italy, you have used
up my ground between you; and you are heartily welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I have no fancy for a short-lived visionary wealth, with the
humiliating sequel of barley-bread and no butter. That will
be your fate presently. Your bliss and your wealth will take
wings; you will wake from your charming dreams of treasure
and diadems, to find that your domestic arrangements are of
quite another kind, like the actors who take the king's part in
tragedies;&mdash;their late majesties King Agamemnon and King
Creon usually return to very short commons on leaving the
theatre. Some depression, some discontent at your existing
arrangements, is to be expected on the occasion. You will be
the worst off, Timolaus. Your flying-machine will come to
grief, like that of Icarus; you will descend from the skies, and
foot it on the ground; and all those rings will slip off and be
lost. As for me, I am content with the exquisite amusement
afforded me by your various wishes; I would not exchange it
for all the treasure in the world, Babylon included. And you
call yourselves philosophers!</p>

<h2>DIALOGUES OF THE HETAERAE</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Glycera. Thais</i>
</p>

<p><i>Gly.</i> Thais, that Acarnanian soldier, who used to be so fond
of Abrotonum, and then fell in love with me&mdash;he was
decorated, and wore a military cloak&mdash;do you know the man I
mean? I suppose you have forgotten him?</p>

<p><i>Th.</i> Oh no, dear, I know; why, he shared our table last
harvest festival. Well? you look as if you had something to
tell me about him.</p>

<p><i>Gly.</i> That wicked Gorgona (such a <i>friend</i> of mine, to be sure!)&mdash;she
has stolen him away from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Th.</i> What! he has given you up, and taken her in your place?</p>

<p><i>Gly.</i> Yes, dear; isn't it <i>horrid</i> of her?</p>

<p><i>Th.</i> Well, Glycera darling, it <i>is</i> wicked, of course; but it is
not very surprising; it is what all we poor girls do. You
mustn't be too much vexed; I shouldn't blame her, if I were
you; Abrotonum never blamed you about him, you know;
and you were friends, too. But <i>I</i> cannot think what he <i>finds</i>
in her; where are his eyes? has he never found out how thin
her hair is? what a lot of forehead she shows! and her lips!
all livid; they might be a dead woman's; and that scraggy
neck, veined all over; and what an amount of nose! I grant
you she is tall and straight; and she has quite a nice smile.</p>

<p><i>Gly.</i> Oh, Thais, you don't think it was her <i>looks</i> caught him.
Don't you know? her mother Chrysarium is a witch; she
knows Thessalian charms, and can draw down the moon; they
do say she flies o' nights. It was she bewitched him with drugs
in his drink, and now they are making their harvest out of
him.</p>

<p><i>Th.</i> Ah well, dear, you will get a harvest out of some one
else; never mind him.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Myrtium. Pamphilus. Doris</i>
</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Well, Pamphilus? So I hear you are to marry Phido
the shipmaster's daughter,&mdash;if you have not done so already!
And this is the end of your vows and tears! All is over and
forgotten! And I so near my time! Yes, that is all I have to
thank my lover for; that, and the prospect of having a child
to bring up; and you know what that means to us poor girls.
I mean to keep the child, especially if it is a boy: it will be some
comfort to me to call him after you; and perhaps some day
you will be sorry, when he comes to reproach you for betraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
his poor mother. I can't say much for the lady's looks. I saw
her only the other day, with her mother, at the Thesmophoria;
little did I know then that she was to rob me of my Pamphilus!
Hadn't you better see what she is like first? Take a good look
at her eyes; and try not to mind the colour, and the cast (she
has such a squint!). Or no: there is no need for you to see
her: you have seen Phido; you know what a face <i>he</i> has.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> How much more nonsense are you going to talk about
shipowners and marriages? What do I know about brides,
ugly or pretty? If you mean Phido of Alopece, I never knew
he had a grown-up daughter at all. Why, now I think of it,
he is not even on speaking terms with my father. They were
at law not long ago&mdash;something about a shipping contract.
He owed my father a talent, I think it was, and refused to pay;
so he was had up before the Admiralty Court, and my father
never got paid in full, after all, so he said. Do you suppose if
I wanted to marry I should pass over Demeas's daughter in
favour of Phido's? Demeas was general last year, and she is
my cousin on the mother's side. Who has been telling you all
this? Is it just a cobweb spun in that jealous little brain of
yours?</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Pamphilus! You mean to say you are <i>not</i> going to be
married?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Are you mad, or what is the matter with you? We did
not have much to drink yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Ask Doris; it is all her fault. I sent her out to buy
some wool, and to offer up prayer to Artemis for me. And she
said that she met Lesbia, and Lesbia &mdash;&mdash; Doris, tell him what
Lesbia said, unless you invented it all yourself.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> May I die, miss, if I said a word more than the truth!
Just by the town-hall Lesbia met me, and 'Doris,' says she,
smiling, 'your young gentleman is to marry Phido's daughter.
And if you don't believe me,' says she, 'look up their street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and you will see everything crowned with garlands, and a fine
bustle going on; flutes playing, and people singing the wedding-song.'</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Well; and you did?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> That I did, sir; and it was all as Lesbia had said.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Ah, now I see! You have told your mistress nothing
but the truth; and there was some ground for what Lesbia
told you. However, it is a false alarm. The wedding is not
at our house. I remember now. When I went back home
yesterday, after leaving you, 'Pamphilus,' said my mother,
'here is neighbour Aristaenetus's son, Charmides, who is no
older than you, just going to marry and settle down: when
are <i>you</i> going to turn over a new leaf?' And then I dropped
off to sleep. I went out early this morning, so that I saw
nothing of all that Doris has seen. If you doubt my word,
Doris can go again; and look more carefully this time, Doris;
mark the house, not the street only, and you will find that the
garlands are next door.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> I breathe again! Pamphilus, if it had been true, I
should have killed myself!</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> <i>True</i>, indeed! Am I mad, that I should forget Myrtium,
so soon to become the mother of my child?</p>

<p class="right">F.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Philinna. Her Mother</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> You must be mad, Philinna; what <i>was</i> the matter
with you at the dinner last night? Diphilus was in tears this
morning when he came and told me how he had been treated.
You were tipsy, he said, and made an exhibition of yourself,
dancing when he asked you not to; then you kissed his friend
Lamprias, and when Diphilus did not like that, you left him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and went and put your arms round Lamprias; and he choking
with rage all the time. And afterwards you would not go
near him, but let him cry by himself, and kept singing and
teasing him.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Ah, mother, he never told you how <i>he</i> behaved; if you
knew how rude he was, you would not take his part. He
neglected me and made up to Thais, Lamprias's girl, before
Lamprias came. I was angry, and let him see what I thought
of him, and then he took hold of Thais's ear, bent her neck back
and gave her&mdash;oh, such a kiss! I thought it would never end.
So I began to cry; but he only laughed, and kept whispering
to her&mdash;about me, of course; Thais was looking at me and
smiling. However, when they heard Lamprias coming, and
had had enough of each other at last, I did take my
place by him all the same, not to give him an excuse for a fuss
afterwards. It was Thais got up and danced first, showing her
ankles ever so much, as if no one else had pretty ones. And
when she stopped, Lamprias never said a word, but Diphilus
praised her to the skies&mdash;such perfect time! such varied steps!
foot and music always right; and what a lovely ankle! and so
on, and so on; it might have been the <i>Sosandra</i> of Calamis he
was complimenting, and not Thais; what she is really like,
<i>you</i> know well enough. And how she insulted me, too!
'If some one is not ashamed of her spindle-shanks,' she
said, 'she will get up and dance now.' Well, that is all,
mammy; of course I did get up and dance. What was I to
do? take it quietly and make her words seem true and let her
be queen?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> You are too touchy, my lass; you should have taken
no notice. But go on.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Well, the others applauded, but Diphilus lay on his
back and looked up at the ceiling, till I was tired and gave up.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> But what about kissing Lamprias? is that true?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and going across and embracing him? Well, why don't you
speak? Those are things I cannot forgive.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> I wanted to pay him out.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> And then not sitting near him! singing while
he was in tears! Think how poor we are, girl; you forget
how much we have had from him, and what last winter would
have been if Aphrodite had not sent him to us.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> I dare say! and I am to let him outrage my feelings just
for that?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Oh, be as angry as you like, but no tit for tat. You
ought to know that if a lover's feelings are outraged his love
ends, and he finds out his folly. You have always been too
hard on the lad; pull too tight, and the rope breaks, you
know.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Melitta. Bacchis</i>
</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> Bacchis, don't you know any of those old women&mdash;there
are any number of them about, 'Thessalians,' they call them&mdash;they
have incantations, you know, and they can make a man in
love with you, no matter how much he hated you before? Do
go and bring me one, there's a dear! I'd give the clothes off
my back, jewellery and all, to see Charinus here again, and to have
him hate Simiche as he hates me at this moment.</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> Melitta! You mean to tell me that Charinus has gone
off after Simiche, and that after making his people so angry
because he wouldn't marry the heiress, all for your sake? She
was to have brought him five talents, so they said. I have not
forgotten what you told me about that.</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> Oh, that is all over now; I have not had a glimpse of
him for the last five days. No; he and Simiche are with his
friend Pammenes enjoying themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> Poor darling! But it can't have been a trifle that drove
him away: what was it all about?</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> I don't know exactly. All I can say is, that he came
back the other day from Piraeus (his father had sent him there
to collect some money), and wouldn't even look at me! I ran
to meet him, expecting him to take me in his arms, instead of
which he pushed me away! 'Go to Hermotimus the ship-owner,'
he said; 'go and read what is written on the column
in the Ceramicus; you will find your name there, and his.'
'Hermotimus? column? what do you mean?' said I. But
he would tell me nothing more; he went to bed without any
dinner, and never gave me so much as a look. I tried everything:
I lavished all my endearments on him, and did all
I could to make him look at me. Nothing would soften him:
all he said was, 'If you keep on bothering, I shall go away this
minute, I don't care what time it is.'</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> But you <i>did</i> know Hermotimus, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> My dear, if I ever so much as heard of a Hermotimus
who was a ship-owner, may I be more wretched than I am now!&mdash;Next
morning, at cock-crow, Charinus got up, and went off.
I remembered his saying something about my name being
written up in the Ceramicus, so I sent Acis to have a look;
and all she found was just this, chalked up close by the Dipylus,
on the right as you come in: <i>Melitta loves Hermotimus</i>; and
again a little lower down: <i>Hermotimus the ship-owner loves
Melitta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> Ah, mischievous boys! I see what it is! Some one
must have written it up to tease Charinus, knowing how jealous
he is. And he took it all in at once! I must speak to him if
I see him anywhere. He is a mere child, quite unsophisticated.</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> If you see him, yes: but you are not likely to. He has
shut himself up with Simiche; his people have been asking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
him, they think he is here still. No, Bacchis, I want one of
those old women; she would put all to rights.</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> Well, love, I know a capital witch; she comes from
Syria, such a brisk, vigorous old thing! Once when Phanias
had quarrelled with me in the same way, all about nothing, she
brought us together again, after four whole months; I had
quite given him up, but her spells drew him back.</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> What was her fee? do you remember?</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> Oh, she was most reasonable: one drachma, and a loaf
of bread. Then you have to provide salt, of course, and sulphur,
and a torch, and seven pennies. And besides this, you
must mix her a bowl of wine, which she has to drink all by herself;
and then there must be something belonging to the man,
his coat, or his shoes, or a lock of hair, or something.</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> I have got his shoes.</p>

<p><i>Ba.</i> She hangs them up on a peg, and fumigates them with
the sulphur, throwing a little salt into the fire, and muttering
both your names. Then she brings out her magic wheel, and
spins it, and rattles off an incantation,&mdash;such horrid, outlandish
words! Well, she had scarcely finished, when, sure enough, in
came Phanias; Phoebis (that was the girl he was with) had
begged and implored him not to go, and his friends declared it
was a shame; but the spell was too strong for them. Oh yes,
and she taught me a splendid charm against Phoebis. I was to
mark her footsteps, and rub out the last of them, putting my
right foot into her left footprint, and my left into her right;
and then I was to say: <i>My foot on thy foot; I trample thee down</i>!
I did it exactly as she told me.</p>

<p><i>Me.</i> Oh, Bacchis, dear, do be quick and fetch the witch.
Acis, you see to the bread and sulphur and things.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Musarium. Her Mother</span>
</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, child, if we get another gallant like Chaereas,
we must make some offerings; the earthly Aphrodite shall have
a white kid, the heavenly one in the Gardens a heifer, and our
lady of windfalls a garland. How well off we shall be, positively
rolling in wealth! You see how much this boy brings in;
not an obol, not a dress, not a pair of shoes, not a box of ointment,
has he ever given you; it is all professions and promises
and distant prospects; always, <i>if</i> my father <i>should</i>&mdash;&mdash;, and I
<i>should</i> inherit, everything <i>would</i> be yours. And according to
you, he swears you shall be his wife.</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Oh yes, mother, he swore it, by the two Goddesses<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and Polias.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> And you believe it, no doubt. So much so that the
other day, when he had a subscription to pay and nothing to
pay with, you gave him your ring without asking me, and the
price of it went in drink. Another time it was the pair of
Ionian necklaces that Praxias the Chian captain got made in
Ephesus and brought you; two darics apiece they weighed;
a club-dinner with the men of his year it was that time. As
for shirts and linen, those are trifles not worth mention. A
mighty catch he has been, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> He is so handsome with his smooth chin; and he loves
me, and cries as he tells me so; and he is the son of Laches the
Areopagite and Dinomache; and we shall be his <i>real</i> wife and
mother-in-law, you know; we have great expectations, if only
the old man would go to bye-bye.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> So when we want shoes, and the shoemaker expects
to be paid, we are to tell him we have no money, 'but take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
few expectations.' And the baker the same. And on rent-day
we shall ask the man to wait till Laches of Collytus is dead;
he shall have it after the wedding. Well, I should be ashamed
to be the only pretty girl that could not show an earring
or a chain or a bit of lace.</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Oh well, mother, are the rest of them happier or better-looking
than I am?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> No; but they have more sense; they know their
business better than to pin their faith to the idle words of
a boy with a mouthful of lover's oaths. But you go in for constancy
and true love, and will have nothing to say to anybody
but your Chaereas. There was that farmer from Acharnae the
other day; his chin was smooth too; and he brought the two
mina he had just got for his father's wine; but oh dear me
no! you send him away with a sneer; none but your Adonis
for you.</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Mother, you could not expect me to desert Chaereas
and let that nasty working-man (faugh!) come near me. Poor
Chaereas! he is a pet and a duck.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Well, the Acharnian did smell rather of the farm.
But there was Antiphon&mdash;son to Menecrates&mdash;and a whole
mina; why not him? he is handsome, and a gentleman, and
no older than Chaereas.</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Ah, but Chaereas vowed he would cut both our throats
if he caught me with him.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> The first time such a thing was ever threatened,
I suppose. So you will go without your lovers for this, and be
as good a girl as if you were a priestess of Demeter instead
of what you are. And if that were all!&mdash;but to-day is harvest
festival; and where is his present?</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Mammy dear, he has none to give.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> They don't all find it so hard to get round their
fathers; why can't he get a slave to wheedle him? why not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
tell his mother he will go off for a soldier if she doesn't let him
have some money? instead of which he haunts and tyrannizes
over us, neither giving himself nor letting us take from those
who would. Do you expect to be eighteen all your life, Musarium?
or that Chaereas will be of the same mind when he
has his fortune, and his mother finds a marriage that will bring
him another? You don't suppose he will remember tears and
kisses and vows, with five talents of dowry to distract him?</p>

<p><i>Mu.</i> Oh yes, he will. They have done everything to make
him marry now; and he wouldn't! that shows.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> I only hope it shows true. I shall remind you of all
this when the time comes.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Ampelis. Chrysis</i>
</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> Well, but, Chrysis, I don't call a man in love at all, if
he doesn't get jealous, and storm, and slap one, and clip one's
hair, and tear one's clothes to pieces.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Is that the only way to tell?</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> To tell a serious passion, yes. The kisses and tears and
vows, the constant attendance,&mdash;all that only shows that he's
<i>beginning</i> to be in love; it's still coming on. But the real
flame is jealousy, pure and simple. So if Gorgias is jealous,
and slaps you, as you say, you may hope for the best; pray that
he may always go on as he has begun!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Go on slapping me?</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> No, no; but getting angry if you ever look at any one
else. If he were not in love with you, why should he mind
your having another lover?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, but I <i>haven't</i>! It's all a mistake! He took it
into his head that old Moneybags had been paying me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
attentions, because I just happened to mention his name
once.</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> Well, that's very nice, too. You want him to think that
there are rich men after you. It will make him all the more
angry, and all the more liberal; he'll be afraid of being cut out
by his rivals.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But Gorgias never gives me anything. He only storms
and slaps.</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> Oh, you wait. Nothing tames them like jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Ampelis, I believe you <i>want</i> me to be slapped!</p>

<p><i>Am.</i> Nonsense! All I mean is this: if you want to make
a man wildly in love with you, let him see that you can do
without him. When he thinks that he has you all to himself,
he is apt to cool down. You see I've had twenty years' experience:
whereas you, I suppose, are about eighteen, perhaps
not that. Come now; I'll tell you what happened to me, not
so many years ago. Demophantus was my admirer in those
days; the usurer, you know, at the back of the Poecile. He
had never given me more than five drachmae at a time, and he
wanted to have everything his own way. The fact was, my
dear, his love was only skin-deep. There were no sighs or tears
with him; no knocking me up at unearthly hours; he would
spend an evening with me now and then&mdash;very occasionally&mdash;and
that was all. But one day when he called, I was 'not at
home'; I had Callides the painter with me (he had given me
ten drachmae). Well, at the time Demophantus said some
very rude things, and walked off. However, the days went by,
and I never sent to him; and at last (finding that Callides had
been with me again) even Demophantus began to catch fire,
and to get into a passion about it; so one day he stood outside,
and waited till he found the door open: my dear, I don't know
what he didn't do! cried, beat me, vowed he would murder
me, tore my clothes dreadfully! And it all ended with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
giving me a talent; after which I saw no one else for eight
months on end. His wife told everybody that I had bewitched
him with some drug. 'Twas easy to see what the drug had
been: jealousy. Now you should try the same drug upon
Gorgias. The boy will have money, if anything happens to
his father.</p>

<p class="right">F.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Dorcas. Pannychis. Philostratus. Polemon</i>
</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, miss, we are lost, lost! Here is Polemon back
from the wars a rich man, they say. I saw him myself in a
mantle with a purple border and a clasp, and a whole train of
men at his back. His friends when they caught sight of him
crowded round to get their greetings in. I made out in the train
his man who went abroad with him. So I said How d'ye do,
and then asked, 'Do tell me, Parmenon, how you got on;
have you made anything to repay you for all your fighting?'</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Ah, you should not have begun with that. Thanks to
all the Gods you were not killed (you ought to have said), and
most of all to Zeus who guards the stranger and Athene who
rules the battle! My mistress was always trying to find out
how you were doing and where you were. And if you had
added that she was always weeping and talking of Polemon, that
would have been still better.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, I said all that right at the beginning; but I never
thought of telling you that; I wanted to get on to the news.
This was how I began to Parmenon: 'Did you and your
master's ears burn, Parmenon?' I said; 'mistress was always
talking of him and crying; and when any one came back from
the last battle and reported that many had been killed, she
would tear her hair and beat her breast, and grieve so every
time!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Ah, that was right, Dorcas.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And then after a little while I went on to the other
questions. And he said, 'Oh, yes, we have come back great
men.'</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> What, straight off like that? never a word of how
Polemon had talked or thought of me, or prayed he might find
me alive?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, he said a good deal of that. But his real news was
enormous riches&mdash;gold, raiment, slaves, ivory. As for the
money, they didn't count it, but measured it by the bushel,
and it took some time that way. On Parmenon's own finger
was a huge queer-shaped ring with one of those three-coloured
stones, the outer part red. I left him when he wanted to give
me the history of how they crossed the Halys and killed somebody
called Tiridates, and how Polemon distinguished himself
in the battle with the Pisidians. I ran off to tell you, and give
you time to think. Suppose Polemon were to come&mdash;and you
may be sure he will, as soon as he has got rid of his company&mdash;and
find when he asked after you that Philostratus was here;
what <i>would</i> he do?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Oh, Dorcas, we <i>must</i> find some way out of it. It would
be shabby to send Philostratus about his business so soon after
having that talent from him; and he is a merchant, and if he
keeps all his promises&mdash;&mdash;. And on the other hand, it is a pity
not to be at home to Polemon now he is come back such a great
man; besides, he is so jealous; when he was poor, there was
no getting on with him for it; and what <i>will</i> he be like now?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Here he comes.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Oh, Dorcas, what <i>am</i> I to do? I shall faint; how I
tremble!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Why, here is Philostratus too.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Oh, what will become of me? oh that the earth would
swallow me up!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Well, my dear, where is that wine?</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> (Now he has gone and done it!) Ah, Polemon, so you
are back at last; are you well?</p>

<p><i>Po.</i> Who is this person coming to you? What, no answer?
Oh, mighty fine, Pannychis! Here have I come on the wings
of love&mdash;the whole way from Thermopylae in five days; and all
for a woman like this! But I deserve it; I ought to be grateful;
I shall not be plundered any more, that is something.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> And who may you be, good sir?</p>

<p><i>Po.</i> Polemon, deme Stiria, tribe Pandionis; will that do for
you? late colonel, now general of division, and Pannychis's
lover, so long as he supposed a mere man was good enough for
her.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> At present, however, sir free-lance, Pannychis is mine.
She has had one talent, and will have another as soon as my
cargoes are disposed of. Come along, Pannychis; the colonel
can keep his colonelling for the Odrysians.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> She is a free woman; it is for her to say whether she
will come along or not.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> What shall I do, Dorcas?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Better go in; Polemon is too angry to talk to now, and
a little jealousy will only whet his appetite.</p>

<p><i>Pa.</i> Well, if you think so, let us go in.</p>

<p><i>Po.</i> I give you both fair warning that you drink your last
drink to-day; I ought to know by this time how to part soul
from body. Parmenon, the Thracians. Full armour, battle
array, this alley blocked. Pikemen in the centre, slingers and
archers on the flanks, and the remainder in the rear.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> You take us for babies, Mr. Mercenary, to judge from
your appeal to our imaginations. Now I wonder whether you
ever shed as much blood as runs in a cock's veins, or ever looked
on war; to stretch a point in your favour, I dare say you may
have been corporal in charge of a bit of wall somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Po.</i> You will know ere long, when you look upon our serried
ranks of glittering steel.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Oh, pack up your traps and come, by all means. I and
my Tibius&mdash;I have only one man, you see&mdash;will scatter you so
wide with a few stones and bricks that you shall never find one
another again.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Tryphaena. Charmides</i>
</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Well, to be sure! Get a girl to keep company with
you, and then turn your back on her! Nothing but tears
and groans! The wine was not good enough, I suppose, and
you didn't want a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> dinner. Oh yes, I saw you were
crying at dinner too. And now it is one continued wail like
a baby's. What <i>is</i> it all about, Charmides? <i>Do</i> tell me; let me
get that much out of my evening with you.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Love is killing me, Tryphaena; I can stand it no longer.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> It is not love for me, that is clear. You would not
be so cold to me, and push me away when I want to put my
arms round you. It really is not fair to keep me off like this!
Never mind, tell me who it is; perhaps I may help you to
her; I know one ought to make oneself useful.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, you two know each other quite well; she is quite
a celebrity.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Name, name, Charmides!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Well then&mdash;Philematium.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Which? there are two of them; one in Piraeus, who
has only just come there; Damyllus the governor's son is in
love with her; is it that one? or the other, the one they call
The Trap?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Yes, that is she; she has caught me and got me tight,
poor mouse.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> And the tears were all for her?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Even so.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Is this recent? or how long has it been going on?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, it is nothing new. I saw her first at the Dionysia;
that makes seven months.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Had you a full view of her, or did you just see her face
and as much as a woman of forty-five likes to show?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, come! I have her word for it she will be two-and-twenty
next birthday.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Well, which are you going to trust&mdash;her word, or your
own eyes? Just take a careful look at her temples some day;
that is the only place where her own hair shows; all the rest is
a thick wig; but at the temples, when the dye fades a little,
you can easily detect the grey. But that is nothing; insist on
seeing more than her face.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, but I am not favoured so far as that.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> No, I should think not. She knows what the effect
would be; why, she is all over&mdash;oh, talk of leopard-skins! And
it was she made you cry like that, was it? I dare say, now, she
was very cruel and scornful?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Yes, she was, dear; and such a lot of money as she has
from me! Just now she wants a thousand drachmas; well,
I am dependent on my father, and he is very close, and I could
not very well get it; so she is at home to Moschion, and will
not see me. That is why you are here; I thought it might
vex her.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> Well, I'm sure I never never would have come if I had
been told what it was for&mdash;just to vex somebody else, and that
somebody old coffin-ripe Philematium! I shall go away; for
that matter the third cock-crow is past.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No, no, not so fast, Tryphaena. If it is all true&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wig, the dye, and the leopard-skin&mdash;I shall hate the sight
of her.</p>

<p><i>Try.</i> If your mother has ever seen her at the bath, ask her.
As to the age, you had better ask your grandfather about that,
if he is alive.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Well, as that is what she is like, come up close to me.
Give me your arms&mdash;and your lips&mdash;and let us be friends.
Philematium be hanged!</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Joessa. Pythias. Lysias</i>
</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Cross boy! But I deserve it all! I ought to have
treated you as any other girl would do,&mdash;bothered you for
money, and been engaged when you called, and made you cheat
your father or rob your mother to get presents for me; instead
of which, I have always let you in from the very first time, and
it has never cost you a penny, Lysias. Think of all the lovers
I have sent away: Ethocles, now a Chairman of Committees,
and Pasion the ship-owner, and young Melissus, who had just
come into all his father's money. I would not have a word to say
to one of them; I kept myself for you, hard-hearted Phaon that
you are! I was fool enough to believe all your vows, and have
been living like a Penelope for your sake; mother is furious
about it, and is always talking at me to her friends. And now
that you feel sure of me, and know how I dote on you, what is
the consequence? You flirt with Lycaena under my very
eyes, just to vex me; you sit next to <i>me</i> at dinner, and pay
compliments to Magidium, a mere music-girl, and hurt my
feelings, and make me cry. And that wine-party the other
day, with Thraso and Diphilus, when Cymbalium the flute-girl
was there, and Pyrallis: you know how I hate that girl:
as for Cymbalium, whom you kissed no less than five times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
I didn't mind so much about that,&mdash;it must have been sufficient
punishment in itself:&mdash;but the way in which you were always
making signs to Pyrallis to notice your cup, and whispering to
the boy, when you gave it back to him, that he was not to fill
it for any one but Pyrallis! and that piece of apple that you bit
off and shot across right into her lap, when you saw that Diphilus
was occupied with Thraso,&mdash;you never even tried to conceal it
from me! and she kissed it, and hid it away beneath her girdle.
What is the meaning of it all? What have I ever done to you?
Did I ever displease you? ever look at any other man? Do
I not live for you alone? A brave thing, is it not, Lysias, to
vex a poor weak woman who loves you to distraction! There
is a Nemesis who watches such deeds. You will be sorry some
day, perhaps, when you hear of my hanging myself, or jumping
head first into a well; for die I will, one way or another, rather
than live to be an eyesore to you. There will be an achievement
for you to boast of! You need not look at me like that,
nor gnash your teeth: if you have anything to say against me,
here is Pythias; let her judge between us. Oh, you are going
away without a word?&mdash;You see what I have to put up with,
Pythias!</p>

<p><i>Py.</i> Monster! He cares nothing for her tears. He must be
made of stone instead of flesh and blood. But the truth is,
my dear, you have spoilt him, by letting him see how fond you
are of him. It is a great mistake to make so much of them;
they get uppish. Don't cry, dear: take my advice, and shut
him out once or twice; it will be his turn to dote on <i>you</i> then.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Shut him out? Don't breathe a word of such a thing!
I only wish he would wait till I turned him out!</p>

<p><i>Py.</i> Why, here he is back again.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Pythias! What <i>have</i> you done? If he should have
overheard that about shutting him out!</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I am coming back on your account, Pythias, not on hers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
I will never look at her again, after what she has done: but
I don't want <i>you</i> to think badly of me; it shall not be said that
Lysias was hard-hearted.</p>

<p><i>Py.</i> Exactly what I <i>was</i> saying.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> But what would you have me do? This girl, who is so
tearful now, has been disloyal to me, and received another
lover; I actually found them together!</p>

<p><i>Py.</i> Well, after all&mdash;&mdash;. But when did you make this discovery?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> It must have been something like five days ago; yes, it
was, because it was on the second, and to-day is the seventh.
My father had found out about this precious Joessa, and how
long it had been going on, and he locked me in, and gave the
porter orders not to open to me. Well, I wasn't going to be
kept away from her, so I told Dromo to slip along the courtyard
to the lowest part of the wall, and then let me mount on his
back; I knew I could easily get over that way. To make a long
story short, I got out, and came here. It was midnight, and
I found the door carefully barred. Instead of knocking, I
quietly lifted the door off its hinges (it was not the first time
I had done so) and passed noiselessly in. Every one was asleep.
I groped my way along the wall, and stopped at the bedside.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Good Heavens! What is coming? I am in torment!</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I perceived from the breathing that there was more than
one person there, and thought at first that Lyde must be sleeping
with her. Pythias, I was mistaken! My hands passed over
a smooth, beardless <i>man's</i> face; the fellow was close-cropped,
and reeked of scent like any woman. I had not brought my
sword with me, or you may be sure I should have known what
to do with it.&mdash;What are you both laughing at? Is it so
amusing, Pythias?</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Oh, Lysias! is that all? Why, it was Pythias who was
sleeping with me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Py.</i> Joessa, don't tell him!</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Why not? Lysias, dear, it <i>was</i> Pythias; I had asked
her to come and sleep with me; I was so lonely without you.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Pythias? Then her hair has grown pretty fast in five
days.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> She has been ill, and her hair was falling off, and she had
to have it cropped. And now she has got false hair. Pythias,
show him that it is so. Behold your rival, Lysias! this is the
young gentleman of whom you were jealous.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> And what lover would not have been jealous? I had
the evidence of my hands, remember.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Well, you know better now. Suppose I were to return
you evil for evil? What should you say to that? It is my
turn to be angry with you now.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No, you mustn't be angry. We will have some wine,
and Pythias must join us; the truce cannot be ratified without
her.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Of course not. A pretty scrape you have led me into,
Pythias, you nice young man!</p>

<p><i>Py.</i> The nice young man has led you out of it again too, so
you must forgive him. I say, Lysias, you need not tell any one&mdash;about
my hair, you know.</p>

<p class="right">F.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Leontichus. Chenidas. Hymnis</i>
</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> And then that battle with the Galatians; tell her about
that, Chenidas&mdash;how I rode out in front on the grey, and the
Galatians (brave fellows, those Galatians, too)&mdash;but they ran
away directly they saw me; not a man stood his ground. That
time, you know, I used my lance for a javelin, and sent it through
their captain and his horse as well; and then, as some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
were left&mdash;the phalanx was broken up, you see, but a certain
number had rallied&mdash;well, I pulled out my trusty blade, rode
at them as hard as I could go, knocked over half a dozen of the
front rank with the mere rush of my horse, brought down my
sword on one of the officers, and clove his head in two halves,
helmet and all. The rest of you came up shortly, you remember,
when they were already running.</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Oh, but that duel of yours with the satrap in Paphlagonia!
that was a fine display, too.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Well remembered; yes, that was not so bad, either.
A great big fellow that satrap was, supposed to be a champion
fighter too&mdash;thought nothing of Greek science. Out he came,
and challenged all comers to single combat. There was consternation
among our officers, from the lowest to the general
himself&mdash;though he was a pretty good man. Aristaechmus the
Aetolian he was&mdash;very strong on the javelin; I was only a
colonel then. However, I was not afraid. I shook off the
friends who clung to me&mdash;they were anxious about me when
they saw the barbarian resplendent in his gilded armour, towering
high with his terrible plume and brandishing his lance&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Yes, <i>I</i> was afraid that time; you remember how I clung
to you and besought you not to sacrifice yourself; life would
not have been worth living, if you had fallen.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> I ventured it, though. Out I went, as well armed as
the Paphlagonian, all gold like him. What a shout there was
on both sides! the barbarians recognized me too; they knew
my buckler and medals and plume. Who was it they all compared
me to, Chenidas?</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Why, who should it be? Achilles, of course; the son
of Peleus and Thetis, of course. Your helmet was so magnificent,
your purple so rich, your buckler so dazzling.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> We met. The barbarian drew first blood&mdash;just a scratch
with his lance a little above the knee; but my great spear drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
through his shield and right into the breast-bone Then I ran
up, just sliced his head off with my sword, and came back carrying
his arms, the head spiked on my spear dripping gore upon
me.</p>

<p><i>Hym.</i> How horrid, Leontichus! what disgusting frightful
tales you tell about yourself! What girl would look at a man
who likes such nastiness&mdash;let alone drink or sleep with him?
I am going away.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Pooh! I double your pay.</p>

<p><i>Hym.</i> No, nothing shall induce me to sleep with a murderer.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Don't be afraid, my dear. All that was in Paphlagonia.
I am a man of peace now.</p>

<p><i>Hym.</i> No, you are unclean; the blood of the barbarian's
head on the spear has dripped over you! I embrace and kiss
a man like that? the Graces forbid! he is no better than the
executioner.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> I am certain you would be in love with me if you had seen
me in my armour.</p>

<p><i>Hym.</i> I tell you it makes me sick and frightened even to hear
of such things; I see the shades and ghosts of the slain; that
poor officer with his head cloven! what would it be if I saw the
thing done, and the blood, and the bodies lying there? I am
sure I should die; I never saw a chicken killed, even.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Such a coward, girl? so poor of heart? I thought you
would like to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Hym.</i> Well, try the Lemnian women, or the daughters of
Danaus, if you want to please with that sort of tale. I shall
run home to my mother, while there is some daylight left.
Come along, Grammis. Good-bye, mightiest of colonels, and
murderer of however many it is!</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Stay, girl, stay.&mdash;Why, she is gone!</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Well, Leontichus, you frightened the simple little thing
with your nodding plumes and your incredible exploits. I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
her getting pale as far back as the officer story; her face was all
puckered up and quivering when you split his head.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> I thought it would make me more attractive. Well,
but it was your fault too; you started the duel.</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Well, I had to chime in when I saw what you were
bragging for. But you laid it on so thick. Pass the cutting
off the wretched Paphlagonian's head, what did you want to
spike it on a spear for, and let the blood run down on you?</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> That was a bit too strong, I admit; the rest was rather
well put together. Well, go and persuade her to come back.</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> Shall I tell her you lied to make her think you a fine
fellow?</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Oh, plague upon it!</p>

<p><i>Che.</i> It's the only way. Choose&mdash;a mighty champion, and
loathed, or a confessed liar, and&mdash;Hymnis?</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> Bad is the best; but I say Hymnis. Go to her, then,
Chenidas, and say I lied&mdash;in parts.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Dorion. Myrtale</i>
</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> So, Myrtale! You ruin me first, and then close your
doors on me! It was another tale when I brought you all
those presents: I was your love, then; your lord, your life.
But you have squeezed me dry now, and have got hold of that
Bithynian merchant; so I am left to whimper on the wrong
side of the door, while he, the favoured lover, enjoys your
embraces, and is to become a father soon, so you tell him.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Come, Dorion, that is too much! Ruined you, indeed!
A lot you ever gave me! Let us go through the list of your
presents, from the very beginning.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> Very well; let us. First, a pair of shoes from Sicyon,
two drachmae. Remember two drachmae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Ah, but you were here for two nights.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> A box of Phoenician ointment, when I came back from
Syria; the box of alabaster. The same price, as I'm a seaman!</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Well, and when you sailed again, didn't I give you that
waistcoat, that you might have something to wear when you
were rowing? It was Epiurus the boatswain's, that waistcoat;
he left it here one night by mistake.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> Epiurus recognized it, and took it away from me in
Samos, only the other day; and a rare tussle we had before he
got it. Then there were those onions I brought you from
Cyprus, and five haddocks and four perch, the time we came
back from the Bosphorus. Oh, and a whole basket of ship's
bread&mdash;eight loaves of it; and a jar of figs from Caria. Another
time it was a pair of slippers from Patara, gilded ones, you
ungrateful girl! Ah, and I was forgetting that great cheese
from Gythium.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Say five drachmae the lot.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> It was all that my pay would run to, Myrtale; I was but
a common seaman in those days. I have risen to be mate now,
my haughty miss. And didn't I put down a solid drachma for
you at the feet of Aphrodite's statue, when it was her feast the
other day? Then I gave your mother two drachmae to buy
shoes with; and Lyde there,&mdash;many is the copper I have slipped
into her hand, by twos and threes. Put all that together, and
it makes a seaman's fortune.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Onions and haddocks.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> Yes; 'twas all I had; if I were rich, I should not be
a sailor. I have never brought my own mother so much as
a head of garlic. I should like to know what sort of presents
the Bithynian makes you?</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> Look at this dress: he bought it me; and this necklace,
the thick one.</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> Pooh, you have had that for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> No, the one you knew was much lighter, and it had no
emeralds. My earrings were a present of his too, and so was
that rug; and he gave me two minae the other day, besides
paying our rent. Rather different from Patara slippers, and
Gythium cheeses and stuff!</p>

<p><i>Do.</i> And how do you like him for a lover? you say nothing
about that. He is fifty years old if he is a day; his hair is all
gone in front, and he has the complexion of a lobster. Did you
ever notice his teeth? And so accomplished too! it is a treat
to hear him when he sings and tries to make himself agreeable;
what is it they tell me about an ass that would learn the lyre?
Well, I wish you joy of him; you deserve no better luck; and
may the child be like his father! As for me, I'll find some
Delphis or Cymbalium that's more in my line; your neighbour,
perhaps, the flute-girl; anyhow, I shall get some one. We
can't all afford necklaces and rugs and two minae presents.</p>

<p><i>Myr.</i> How I envy the lucky girl who gets you, Dorion!
What onions she will have from Cyprus! what cheeses next
time you come from Gythium!</p>

<p class="right">F.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Cochlis. Parthenis</i>
</p>

<p><i>Co.</i> Crying, Parthenis! what is it? how do your pipes come
to be broken?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Oh! oh! I have been beaten by Crocale's lover&mdash;that
tall Aetolian soldier; he found me playing at Crocale's,
hired by his rival Gorgus. He broke in while they were at
dinner, smashed my pipes, upset the table, and emptied out the
wine-bowl. Gorgus (the country fellow, you know) he pulled
out of the dining-room by the hair of his head, and the two of
them, Dinomachus (I think they call him) and a fellow soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
stood over thumping him. Oh, Cochlis, I doubt whether he
will live; there was a great rush of blood from his nostrils, and
his face is all swollen and livid.</p>

<p><i>Co.</i> Is the man mad? or was it just a drunken freak?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> All jealousy, my dear&mdash;love run wild. Crocale had
asked two talents, I believe, if Dinomachus wanted her all to
himself. He refused; so she shut the door in his face, I was
told, and would not let him in at all. Instead of him she took
Gorgus of Oeno&euml;, a well-to-do farmer and a nice man; they
were drinking together, and she had got me in to play the pipes.
Well, the wine was going, I was striking up one of those Lydian
tunes, the farmer standing up to dance, Crocale clapping, and
all as merry as could be. Suddenly there was a noise and a
shout, crash went the front door, and a moment after in burst
eight great strong men, that brute among them. Everything
was upside down directly, Gorgus on the ground, as I told you,
being thumped and kicked. Crocale got away somehow and
took refuge with Thespias next door. Dinomachus boxed my
ears, and 'Go to blazes!' he said, throwing me the broken
pipes. I am running to tell master about it now. And the
farmer is going to find some of his friends in town and get the
brute summonsed in the police-court.</p>

<p><i>Co.</i> Yes, bruises and the courts&mdash;that is all we get out of the
military. They tell you they are generals and colonels, and
then when it comes to paying, 'Oh, wait for settling day,' they
say; 'then I shall get my pay, and put everything right.'
I wish they were all dead, they and their bragging. But I
never have anything to do with them; it is the best way.
Give me a fisherman or a sailor or farmer no better than myself,
with few compliments and plenty of money. These plume-tossing
word-warriors! they are nothing but noise, Parthenis.</p>

<h2>THE DEATH OF PEREGRINE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucian</span> to <span class="smcap">Cronius</span>. Greeting.</p>

<p>Poor dear Peregrine&mdash;or Proteus, as he loved to call himself,&mdash;has
quite come up to his namesake in Homer. We have seen
him under many shapes: countless have been his transformations
for glory's sake; and now&mdash;'tis his last appearance&mdash;we
see him in the shape of fire. So vast was his ambition. Yes,
Cronius; all that is left of the best of men is a handful of ashes.
It's just like Empedocles; only with a difference. That philosopher
would fain have sneaked into his crater unobserved:
not so our high-souled friend. He bides his time till all Greece
is mustered in full force&mdash;constructs a pyre of the largest
dimensions&mdash;and jumps on top in the eyes of all the world,
having briefly addressed the nation a few days before on the
subject of his daring enterprise! I fancy I see you chuckling
away at the old dotard; or rather I hear you blurting out the
inevitable comments&mdash;'Mere imbecility'&mdash;'Mere clap-trap'-'Mere ...'
everything else that we are accustomed to attribute
to these gentry. But then you are far enough off to be
comparatively safe: now <i>I</i> made my remarks before a vast
audience, in the very moment of cremation (and before it
for that matter), exciting thereby the indignation of all the old
fool's admirers, though there were a few who joined in the
laugh against him. I can tell you, I was within an ace of
being torn limb from limb by the Cynics, like Actaeon among
the dogs, or his cousin Pentheus among the Maenads.&mdash;But
I must sketch you the whole drama in detail. As to our author,
I say nothing: you know the man, you know the sublime utterances
that marked his earthly course, out-voicing Sophocles and
Aeschylus.</p>

<p>Well, the first thing I did when I got to Elis was to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a turn in the gymnasium, listening the while to the discordant
yells of some Cynic or other;&mdash;the usual platitudes, you know;&mdash;ringing
commendations of Virtue&mdash;indiscriminate slaughter
of characters&mdash;finally, a peroration on the subject of Proteus.
I must try and give you the exact words, as far as I can remember
them; you will recognize the true Cynic yell, I'll be bound;
you have heard it before.</p>

<p>'Proteus,' he cried, 'Proteus vain-glorious? Who dares
name the word? Earth! Sun! Seas! Rivers! God of our fathers,
Heracles! Was it for this that he suffered bondage in Syria?
that he forgave his country a debt of a million odd? that he was
cast out of Rome,&mdash;he whose brilliance exceeds the Sun, fit rival
of the Lord of Olympus? 'Tis his good will to depart from life by
fire, and they call it vain-glory! What other end had Heracles?
'Twas the thunderbolt, methinks, that slew Asclepius, Dionysus<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>?
'Twas in the crater that Empedocles sought death?'</p>

<p>Theagenes (our friend with the lungs) had got thus far, when
I asked one of the bystanders what all this meant about 'fire,'
and what Heracles and Empedocles had got to do with Proteus?&mdash;'Proteus,'
he replied, 'will shortly cremate himself, at the
Olympic games.'&mdash;'But how,' I asked, 'and why?' He did
his best to explain, but the Cynic went on bawling, and it was
quite out of the question to attend to anything else. I waited
on to the end. It was one torrent of wild panegyric on Proteus.
The sage of Sinope, Antisthenes his master,&mdash;nay,
Socrates himself&mdash;none of them were so much as to be compared
with him. Zeus was invited to contend for the pre-eminence.
Subsequently however it seemed advisable to leave
the two on some sort of equality. 'The world,' he cried in
conclusion, 'has seen but two works of surpassing excellence,
the Olympian Zeus, and&mdash;Proteus. The one we owe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
creative genius of Phidias; the other is Nature's handiwork.
And now, this godlike statue departs from among mankind;
borne upon wings of fire, he seeks the heavens, and leaves us
desolate.' He had worked himself up into a state of perspiration
over all this; and when it was over he was very absurd, and
cried, and tore his hair,&mdash;taking care not to pull too hard; and
was finally taken away by some compassionate Cynics, sobbing
violently all the time.</p>

<p>Well, after him, up jumped somebody else, before the crowd
had time to disperse; pouring his libation upon the glowing
embers of the previous sacrifice. He commenced operations
with a loud guffaw&mdash;there was no doubting its sincerity&mdash;after
which he addressed us as follows. 'Theagenes (Heaven forgive
him!) concluded his vile rant with the tears of Heraclitus:
I, on the other hand, propose to begin with the laughs of
Democritus.' Another hearty guffaw, in which most of us
were fain to join. 'One simply can't help it,' he remarked,
pulling himself together, 'when one hears such sad stuff talked,
and sees old men practically standing on their heads for the
public amusement,&mdash;and all to keep their grubby little reputations
alive! Now, if you want to know all about this "statue"
which proposes to cremate itself, I'm your man. I have marked
his career from the first, and followed his intellectual development;
and I learnt a good deal from his fellow citizens, and
others whose authority was unquestionable.</p>

<p>'To begin then, this piece of perfect workmanship, straight
from Nature's mould, this type of true proportion, had barely
come of age, when he was caught in adultery; in Armenia this
was; he received a brisk drubbing for his pains, and finally made
a jump of it from the roof, and so got off. His next exploit
was the corruption of a handsome boy. This would have
brought him before the Governor, by rights; but the parents
were poor, and he bought them off to the tune of a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and twenty pounds. But perhaps it is hardly worth while
mentioning trifles of this kind. Our clay, you see, is yet unwrought:
the "perfect workmanship" is still to come. That
business about his father makes rather good hearing: only you
know all about that;&mdash;how the old fellow would hang on,
though he was past sixty already, till Proteus could stand it
no longer, and put a noose about his neck. Well, this began to
be talked about; so he passed sentence of banishment on himself,
and wandered about from place to place.</p>

<p>'It was now that he came across the priests and scribes of the
Christians, in Palestine, and picked up their queer creed. I
can tell you, he pretty soon convinced them of his superiority;
prophet, elder, ruler of the Synagogue&mdash;he was everything at
once; expounded their books, commented on them, wrote books
himself. They took him for a God, accepted his laws, and
declared him their president. The Christians, you know, worship
a <i>man</i> to this day,&mdash;the distinguished personage who introduced
their novel rites, and was crucified on that account.
Well, the end of it was that Proteus was arrested and thrown
into prison. This was the very thing to lend an air to his
favourite arts of clap-trap and wonder-working; he was now
a made man. The Christians took it all very seriously: he was
no sooner in prison, than they began trying every means to get
him out again,&mdash;but without success. Everything else that
could be done for him they most devoutly did. They thought
of nothing else. Orphans and ancient widows might be seen
hanging about the prison from break of day. Their officials
bribed the gaolers to let them sleep inside with him. Elegant
dinners were conveyed in; their sacred writings were read; and
our old friend Peregrine (as he was still called in those days)
became for them "the modern Socrates." In some of the Asiatic
cities, too, the Christian communities put themselves to the
expense of sending deputations, with offers of sympathy, assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>ance,
and legal advice. The activity of these people, in dealing
with any matter that affects their community, is something
extraordinary; they spare no trouble, no expense. Peregrine,
all this time, was making quite an income on the strength of
his bondage; money came pouring in. You see, these misguided
creatures start with the general conviction that they are
immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death
and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them;
and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver
that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are
converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified
sage, and live after his laws. All this they take quite on
trust, with the result that they despise all worldly goods alike,
regarding them merely as common property. Now an adroit,
unscrupulous fellow, who has seen the world, has only to get
among these simple souls, and his fortune is pretty soon made;
he plays with them.</p>

<p>'To return, however, to Peregrine. The governor of Syria
perceived his mental warp: "he must make a name, though
he die for it:" now philosophy was the governor's hobby; he
discharged him&mdash;wouldn't hear of his being punished&mdash;and
Peregrine returned to Armenia. He found it too hot to hold
him. He was threatened from all quarters with prosecutions
for parricide. Then again, the greater part of his property
had disappeared in his absence: nothing was left but the
land, which might be worth a matter of four thousand pounds.
The whole estate, as the old man left it, would come perhaps
to eight thousand. Theagenes was talking nonsense when he
said a million odd. Why, the whole city, with its five nearest
neighbours thrown in, men, cattle, and goods of every description,
would never fetch that sum.&mdash;Meanwhile, indictments
and accusations were brewing: an attack might be looked
for at any moment: as for the common people, they were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a state of furious indignation and grief at the foul butchery
of a harmless old man; for so he was described. In these
trying circumstances, observe the ingenuity and resource of
the sagacious Proteus. He makes his appearance in the assembly:
his hair (even in these early days) is long, his cloak is shabby;
at his side is slung the philosopher's wallet, his hand grasps
the philosopher's staff; truly a tragic figure, every inch of him.
Thus equipped, he presents himself before the public, with
the announcement that the property left him by his father
of blessed memory is entirely at their disposal! Being a needy
folk, with a keen eye to charity, they received the information
with ready applause: "Here is true philosophy; true patriotism;
the spirit of Diogenes and Crates is here!" As for his
enemies, they were dumb; and if any one did venture an
allusion to parricide, he was promptly stoned.</p>

<p>'Proteus now set out again on his wanderings. The Christians
were meat and drink to him; under their protection he
lacked nothing, and this luxurious state of things went on for
some time. At last he got into trouble even with them; I
suppose they caught him partaking of some of their forbidden
meats. They would have nothing more to do with him, and
he thought the best way out of his difficulties would be, to
change his mind about that property, and try and get it back.
He accordingly sent in a petition to the emperor, suing for its
restitution. But as the people of Parium sent up a deputation
to remonstrate, nothing came of it all; he was told that as he
had been under no compulsion in making his dispositions, he
must abide by them.</p>

<p>'Pilgrimage number three, to Egypt, to see Agathobulus.
Here he went through a most interesting course of discipline:
shaved half his head bare; anointed his face with mud; grossly
exposed himself before a large concourse of spectators, as a
practical illustration of "Stoic indifference"; received castiga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tion
with a birch rod; administered the same; and mystified
the public with a number of still more extravagant follies.
Thus prepared, he took ship to Italy, and was scarcely on dry
land again when he began abusing everybody, especially the
Emperor, on whose indulgence and good nature he knew that
he could safely rely. The Emperor, as you may suppose, was
not greatly concerned at his invectives; and it was his theory
that no one in the garb of philosophy should be called to account
for his words, least of all a specialist in scandal. Proteus's
reputation throve upon neglect. The crack-brained philosopher
became the cynosure of unsophisticated eyes; and he
grew at last to be so unbearable that the city prefect judiciously
expelled him: "we do not require philosophers of your school,"
he explained. Even this made for his notoriety: he was in every
one's mouth as the philosopher who was banished for being
too outspoken, and saying what he thought. He took rank
with Musonius, Dion, Epictetus, and others who have been in
the same predicament.</p>

<p>'Finally, Proteus arrives in Greece; and what does he do
there? He makes himself offensive in Elis; he instigates
Greece to revolt against Rome; he finds a man of enlarged
views and established character<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, a public benefactor in general,
and in particular the originator of the water-supply to Olympia,
which saved that great assembly from perishing of thirst&mdash;and
he has nothing but hard words for him; "Greece is demoralized,"
he cries; "the spectators of the games should
have done without water, ay, and died if need be,"&mdash;and so
many of them would have done, from the violence of the epidemics
then raging in consequence of the drought. And all
the time Proteus was drinking of that very water! At this
there was a general rush to stone him, which pretty nearly
succeeded; it was all our magnanimous friend could do, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the time being, to find salvation at the altar of Zeus. He
spent the four following years in composing a speech, which
he delivered in public at the next Olympic games; it consisted
of encomiums on the donor of the water-supply and explanations
of his flight on the former occasion. But by this time
people had lost all curiosity about him; his prestige was quite
gone; everything fell flat, and he could devise no more novelties
for the amazement of chance-comers, nor elicit the admiration
and applause for which he had always so passionately longed.
Hence this last bold venture of the funeral-pyre. So long ago
as the last Olympic Games he published his intention of cremating
himself at the next. That is what all this mystification
is about, this digging of pits we hear of, and collecting of firewood;
these glowing accounts of fortitude hereafter to be
shown. Now, in the first place, it seems to me that a man
has no business to run away from life: he ought to wait till
his time comes. But if nothing else will serve, if positively he
must away,&mdash;still there is no need of pyres and such-like solemn
paraphernalia: there are plenty of ways of dying without this;
let him choose one of them, and have done with it. Or if
a fiery end is so attractively Heraclean, what was to prevent
his quietly selecting some well-wooded mountain top, and doing
his cremation all by himself, with Theagenes or somebody to
play Philoctetes to his Heracles? But no; he must roast
in full concourse, at Olympia, as it might be on a stage; and,
so help me Heracles, he is not far out, if justice is to be done
on all parricides and unbelievers. Nay, if we look at it that
way, this is but dilatory work: he might have been packed
into Phalaris's bull years ago, and he would have had no more
than his deserts,&mdash;a mouthful of flame and sudden death is too
good for him. For by all I can learn burning is the quickest
of deaths; a man has but to open his mouth, and all is over.</p>

<p>'But I suppose what runs in his mind is the imposing spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of a man being burnt alive in the holy place, in which
ordinary mortality may not so much as be buried. There was
another man, once on a time, who wanted to be famous. I dare
say you have heard of him. When he found there was no
other way, he set fire to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
Proteus's design reminds me of that. The passion for fame
must wholly possess him, body and soul. He says, of course,
that it is all for the benefit of the human race,&mdash;to teach them
to scorn death, and to show fortitude in trying circumstances.
Now I should just like to ask you a question; it is no use asking
him. How would you like it, if the criminal classes were to
profit by his lesson in fortitude, and learn to scorn death, and
burning, and so on? You would not like it at all. Then
how is Proteus going to draw the line? How is he going to
improve the honest men, without hardening and encouraging
the rogues? Suppose it even to be practicable that none
should be present at the spectacle but such as will make a good
use of it. Again I ask: do you want your sons to conceive
an ambition of this sort? Of course not. However, I need
not have raised that point: not a soul, even among his own
disciples, will be caught by his enthusiasm. That is where
I think Theagenes is so much to blame: in all else he is a
zealous adherent: yet when his master sets out "to be with
Heracles,"&mdash;he stops behind, he won't go! though it is but
a single header into the flames, and in a moment endless felicity
is his. It is not zeal, to have the same kind of stick and coat
and scrip as another man; any one can do that; it is both
safe and easy. Zeal must appear in the end, in the consummation:
let him get together his pyre of fig-tree faggots, as
green as may be, and gasp out his last amid the smoke! For
as to merely being burnt, Heracles and Asclepius have
no monopoly there: temple-robbers and murderers may
be seen experiencing the same fate in the ordinary course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of law. Smoke is the only death, if you want to have it all to
yourselves.</p>

<p>'Besides, if Heracles really ever did anything so stupendous
at all, he was driven to it by frenzy; he was being consumed
alive by the Centaur's blood,&mdash;so the play tells us. But what
point is there in Proteus's throwing himself into the fire? Ah,
of course: he wants to set an example of fortitude, like the
Brahmins, to whom Theagenes thought it necessary to compare
him. Well, I suppose there may be fools and empty-headed
enthusiasts in India as elsewhere? Anyhow, he might
stick to his models. The Brahmins never jump straight into
the fire: Onesicritus, Alexander's pilot, saw Calanus burn himself,
and according to him, when the pyre has been got ready,
they stand quietly roasting in front of it, and when they do get
on top, there they sit, smouldering away in a dignified manner,
never budging an inch. I see nothing so great in Proteus's
just jumping in and being swallowed by the flames. As likely
as not he would jump out when he was half done; only, as I
understand, he is taking care to have the pyre in a good deep hole.</p>

<p>'Some say that he is beginning to think better of it; that
he reports certain dreams, to the effect that Zeus will not suffer
the holy place to be profaned. Let him be easy on that score.
I dare swear that not a God of them will have any objection to
a rogue's dying a rogue's death. To be sure, he won't easily
get out of it now. His Cynic friends egg him on and thrust
him pyre-wards; they keep his ambition aglow; there shall be
no flinching, if <i>they</i> can help it! If Proteus would take a couple
of them with him in the fatal leap, it would be the first good
action he has ever performed.</p>

<p>'Not even "Proteus" will serve now, they were saying: he
has changed his name to Phoenix; that Indian bird being
credited with bringing a prolonged existence to an end upon
a pyre. He tells strange tales too, and quotes oracles&mdash;guaran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>teed
old&mdash;to the effect that he is to be a guardian spirit of the
night. Evidently he has conceived a fancy for an altar, and
looks to have his statue set up, all of gold. And upon my word
it is as likely as not that among the simple vulgar will be found
some to declare that Proteus has cured them of the ague, and
that in the darkness they have met with the "guardian spirit of
the night." And as the ancient Proteus, the son of Zeus, the
great original, had the gift of prophecy, I suppose these precious
disciples of the modern one will be for getting up an oracle and
a shrine upon the scene of cremation. Mark my words: we
shall find we have got Protean priests of the scourge; priests of
the branding-iron; priests of some strange thing or other; or&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;nocturnal rites in his honour, with a torchlight
procession about the pyre. I heard but now, from a friend, of
Theagenes's producing a prophecy of the Sibyl on this subject:
he quoted the very words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What time the noblest of the Cynic host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the Thunderer's court shall light a fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leap into its midst, and thence ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To great Olympus&mdash;then shall all mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who eat the furrow's fruit, give honour due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Night-wanderer. His seat shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by Hephaestus and lord Heracles.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That's the oracle that Theagenes says he heard from the Sibyl.
Now I'll give him one of Bacis's on the same subject. Bacis
speaks very much to the point as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What time the Cynic many-named shall leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred in his heart with mad desire for fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into hot fire&mdash;then shall the Fox-dogs all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His followers, go hence as went the Wolf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him that shuns Hephaestus' fiery might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' Achaeans all shall straightway slay with stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, cool in courage, he essay warm words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuffing with gold of usury his scrip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in fair Patrae he hath thrice five talents.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>What say you, friends? Can Bacis turn an oracle too, as well
as the Sibyl? Apparently it is time for the esteemed followers
of Proteus to select their spots for "evaporation," as they call
burning.'</p>

<p>A universal shout from the audience greeted this conclusion:
'Away with them to the fire! 'tis all they are good for.' The
orator descended, beaming.</p>

<p class="center">But Nestor marked the uproar&mdash;
</p>

<p>The shouts no sooner reached Theagenes's ears, than he was
back on the platform, bawling out all manner of scandal against
the last speaker (I don't know what this capital fellow was
called). However, I left Theagenes there, bursting with indignation,
and went off to see the games, as I heard the stewards
were already on the course. So much for Elis.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Olympia, we found the vestibule full of
people, all talking about Proteus. Some were inveighing
against him, others commended his purpose; and most of them
had come to blows about it when, just after the Heralds' contest,
in came Proteus himself, with a multitudinous escort, and
gave us a speech, all about himself;&mdash;the life he had lived, the
risks he had run, the trials he had undergone in the cause of
philosophy. He had a great deal to say, but I heard very little
of it; there was such a crowd. Presently I began to think
I should be squeezed to death in the crush (I saw this actually
happen to several people), so off I went, having had enough
of this sophist in love with death, and his anticipatory epitaph.
Thus much I heard, however. Upon a golden life he desired to
set a golden crown. He had lived like Heracles: like Heracles
he must die, and mingle with the upper air. ''Tis my aim,'
he continued, 'to benefit mankind; to teach them how contemptible
a thing is death. To this end, the world shall be my
Philoctetes.' The simpler souls among his audience wept, cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ing
'Live, Proteus; live for Greece!' Others were of sterner
stuff, and expressed hearty approval of his determination. This
discomposed the old man considerably. His idea had been that
they would never let him go near the pyre; that they would all
cling about him and insist on his continuing a compulsory existence.
He had the complexion of a corpse before: but this
wholly unexpected blow of approbation made him turn several
degrees paler: he trembled&mdash;and broke off.</p>

<p>Conceive my amusement! Pity it was impossible to feel for
such morbid vanity: among all who have ever been afflicted
with this scourge, Proteus stands pre-eminent. However, he had
a fine following, and drank his fill of notoriety, as he gazed on
the host of his admirers; poor man! he forgot that criminals
on the way to the cross, or in the executioner's hands, have
a greater escort by far.</p>

<p>And now the games were over. They were the best I had
ever seen, though this makes my fourth visit to Olympia. In
the general rush of departure, I got left behind, finding it
impossible to procure a conveyance.</p>

<p>After repeated postponements, Proteus had finally announced
a late hour of the night for his exhibition. Accordingly, at
about midnight I got up (I had found lodgings with a friend),
and set out for Harpine; for here was the pyre, just two miles
and a half from Olympia, going East along the racecourse. We
found on arrival that the pyre had been placed in a hole, about
six feet deep. To ensure speedy ignition, it had been composed
chiefly of pine-torches, with brushwood stuffed in between.</p>

<p>As soon as the moon had risen&mdash;for her presence too was
required at the glorious spectacle&mdash;Proteus advanced, in his
usual costume, accompanied by the chiefs of the Cynics; conspicuous
among them came the pride of Patrae, torch in hand;
nobly qualified for the part he was to play. Proteus too had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
his torch. They drew near to the pyre, and kindled it at several
points; as it contained nothing but torches and brushwood,
a fine blaze was the result. Then Proteus&mdash;are you attending,
Cronius?&mdash;Proteus threw aside his scrip, and cloak, and club&mdash;his
club of Heracles&mdash;and stood before us in scrupulously unclean
linen. He demanded frankincense, to throw upon the
fire; being supplied he first threw it on, then, turning to the
South (another tragic touch, this of the South), he exclaimed:
'Gods of my mother, Gods of my father, receive me with
favour.' And with these words he leapt into the pyre. There
was nothing more to be seen, however; the towering mass of
flames enveloped him completely.</p>

<p>Again, sweet sir, you smile over the conclusion of my tragedy.
As for me, I saw nothing much in his appealing to his mother's
Gods, but when he included his <i>father's</i> in the invocation,
I laughed outright; it reminded me of the parricide story. The
Cynics stood dry-eyed about the pyre, gazing upon the flames
in silent manifestation of their grief. At last, when I was half
dead with suppressed laughter, I addressed them. 'Intelligent
sirs,' I said, 'let us go away. No pleasure is to be derived
from seeing an old man roasted, and there is a horrible smell
of burning. Are you waiting for some painter to come along
and take a sketch of you, to match the pictures of Socrates in
prison, with his companions at his side?' They were very
angry and abusive at first, and some took to their sticks: but
when I threatened to pick a few of them up and throw them on
to the fire to keep their master company, they quieted down
and peace was restored.</p>

<p>Curious reflections were running in my mind, Cronius, as
I made my way back. 'How strange a thing is this same
ambition!' I said to myself; ''tis the one irresistible passion;
irresistible to the noblest of mankind, as we account them,&mdash;how
much more to such as Proteus, whose wild, foolish life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
may well end upon the pyre!' At this point I met a number
of people coming out to assist at the spectacle, thinking to find
Proteus still alive; for among the various rumours of the preceding
day, one had been, that before entering the fire he was
to greet the rising sun, which to be sure is said to be the
Brahmin practice. Most of them turned back when I told them
that all was over; all but those enthusiasts who could not rest
without seeing the identical spot, and snatching some relic from
the flames. After this, you may be sure, my work was cut out
for me: I had to tell them all about it, and to undergo a minute
cross-examination from everybody. If it was some one I liked
the look of, I confined myself to plain prose, as in the present
narrative: but for the benefit of the curious simple, I put in
a few dramatic touches on my own account. No sooner had
Proteus thrown himself upon the kindled pyre, than there
was a tremendous earthquake, I informed them; the ground
rumbled beneath us; and a vulture flew out from the midst
of the flames, and away into the sky, exclaiming in human
accents</p>

<p class="center">'I rise from Earth, I seek Olympus.'
</p>

<p>They listened with amazement and shuddering reverence. 'Did
the vulture fly East or West?' they wanted to know. I answered
whichever came uppermost.</p>

<p>On getting back to Olympia, I stopped to listen to an old
man who was giving an account of these proceedings; a credible
witness, if ever there was one, to judge by his long beard and
dignified appearance in general. He told us, among other
things, that only a short time before, just after the cremation,
Proteus had appeared to him in white raiment; and that he
had now left him walking with serene countenance in the
Colonnade of Echoes, crowned with olive; and on the top of all
this he brought in the vulture, solemnly swore that he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
it himself flying away from the pyre,&mdash;my own vulture, which
I had but just let fly, as a satire on crass stupidity!</p>

<p>Only think what work we shall have with him hereafter!
Significant bees will settle on the spot; grasshoppers beyond
calculation will chirrup; crows will perch there, as over Hesiod's
grave,&mdash;and all the rest of it. As for statues, several, I know,
are to be put up at once, by Elis and other places, to which,
I understand, he had sent letters. These letters, they say,
were dispatched to almost all cities of any importance: they
contain certain exhortations and schemes of reform, as it were
a legacy. Certain of his followers were specially appointed by
him for this service: <i>Couriers to the Grave</i> and <i>Grand Deputies of
the Shades</i> were to be their titles.</p>

<p>Such was the end of this misguided man; one who, to give
his character in a word, never to his last day suffered his gaze
to rest on Truth; whose words, whose actions had but one
aim,&mdash;notoriety and vulgar applause. 'Twas the love of applause
that drove him to the pyre, where applause could no
longer reach his ears, nor gratify his vanity.</p>

<p>One anecdote, and I have done; it will keep you in amusement
for some time to come. I told you long ago, on my
return from Syria, how I had come on the same ship with him
from Troas, and what airs he put on during the voyage, and
about the handsome youth whom he converted to Cynicism, by
way of having an Alcibiades all of his own, and how he woke up
one night in mid-ocean to find a storm breaking on us, and
a heavy sea rolling, and how the superb philosopher, for whom
Death had no terrors, was found wailing among the women. All
that you know. But a short time before his death, about
a week or so, he had a little too much for dinner, I suppose,
and was taken ill in the night, and had a sharp attack of fever.
Alexander was the physician called in to attend him, and it was
from him I got the story. He said he found Proteus rolling on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the ground, unable to endure the fever, and making passionate
demands for water. Alexander said no to this: and he told
him that if he really wanted to die, here was death, unbidden,
at his very door; he had only to attend the summons; there
was no need of a pyre. 'No, no,' says Proteus; 'any one
may die that way; there's no distinction in it.'</p>

<p>So much for Alexander. I myself, not so long ago, saw
Proteus with some irritant rubbed on his eyes to purge them of
rheum. Evidently we are to infer that there is no admission
for blear eyes in the kingdom of Aeacus. 'Twas as if a man on
the way to be crucified were to concern himself about a sprained
finger. Think if Democritus had seen all this! How would he
have taken it? The laughing philosopher might have done
justice to Proteus. I doubt, indeed, whether he ever had such
a good excuse for his mirth.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, you, my friend, shall have your laugh;
especially when you hear Proteus's name mentioned with admiration.</p>

<h2>THE RUNAWAYS</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Apollo. Zeus. Philosophy. Heracles. Hermes. Three Masters.
An Innkeeper. Orpheus. Innkeeper's Wife. Three Runaway
Slaves.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Apol.</i> Father, is this true, about a man's publicly throwing
himself upon a pyre, at the Olympian Games? He was quite
an old man, it seems, and rather a good hand at anything in the
sensational line. Selene told us about it: she says she actually
saw him burning.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Quite true, my boy; only too true!</p>

<p><i>Apol.</i> Oh? the old gentleman deserved a better fate?</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Why, as to that, I dare say he did. But I was alluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to the smell, which incommoded me extremely; the odour of
roast man, I need hardly tell you, is far from pleasant. I made
the best of my way to Arabia at once, or, upon my word, those
awful fumes would have been the death of me. Even in that
fragrant land of frankincense and spices I could scarcely get the
villanous stench out of my nostrils; the mere recollection of it
makes me feel queer.</p>

<p><i>Apol.</i> But what was his object, father? Was there anything
to be got by jumping on to a pyre, and being converted
to cinders?</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Ah, if you come to that, you must call Empedocles to
account first: <i>he</i> jumped into a crater, in Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Apol.</i> Poor fellow! he must have been in a sad way. But
what was the inducement in the present case?</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> I'll quote you his own words. He made a speech,
explaining his motives to the public. As far as I remember, he
said&mdash;but who comes here in such haste? There must be
something wrong: she is crying; some one has been ill-treating
her. Why, it is Philosophy, in a sad way, calling out to me.
Why are you crying, child? and what brings you here, away
from the world? More misdeeds of the ignorant herd? a
repetition of the Socrates and Anytus affair? is that it?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> No, father, nothing of that kind. The common people
have been most polite and respectful; they are my most devout
admirers,&mdash;worshippers, I might almost say; not that they
understand much of what I tell them. No; it was those&mdash;I
don't know what to call them&mdash;but the people who pretend
to be on such friendly terms with me, and are always using my
name;&mdash;the wretches!</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Oh, it's the philosophers who have been misbehaving
themselves?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> No, no, father; they have been just as badly treated as
I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Then if it is neither the philosophers nor the common
people, who is it that you complain of?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> There are some people who are between the two: they
are not philosophers, and yet they are not like the rest of mankind.
They are got up to look like philosophers; they have
the dress, the walk, the expression; they call me mistress, write
philosopher after their names, and declare themselves my disciples
and followers: but they are evil men, made up of folly
and impudence and wickedness; a disgrace to my name. It
was their misconduct that drove me away.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Poor child! it is too bad of them. And what have they
been doing to you exactly?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Judge for yourself whether the provocation was a slight
one. When formerly you looked down upon the world, and
saw that it was filled with iniquity and transgression, and was
become the troubled abode of sin and folly, you had compassion
on the frailty of ignorant mankind, and sent me down to them:
you bade me see to it, that wickedness and violence and brutality
should cease from among them; I was to lift their eyes upwards
to the truth, and cause them to live together in unity. Remember
your words on that occasion: 'Behold, my daughter,
the misdeeds of mankind; behold how ignorance has wrought
upon them. I feel compassion for them, and have chosen you
from among all the Gods to heal their ills; for who else should
heal them?'</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> I said that, and more. Yes? and how did they receive
you at your first descent? and what is the trouble now?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> My first flight was not directed towards Greece. I
thought it best to begin with the hardest part of my task,
which I took to be the instruction of the barbarians. With
the Greeks I anticipated no difficulty; I had supposed that
they would accept my yoke without hesitation. First, then,
I went to the Indians, the mightiest nation upon earth. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
little trouble in persuading them to descend from their elephants
and follow me. The Brahmins, who dwell between Oxydracae
and the country of the Nechrei, are mine to a man: they live
according to my laws, and are respected by all their neighbours;
and the manner of their death is truly wonderful.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Ah, to be sure: the Gymnosophists. I have heard
a great deal of them. Among other things, they ascend gigantic
pyres, and sit quietly burning to death without moving a muscle.
However, that is no such great matter: I saw it done at Olympia
only the other day. You would be there, no doubt,&mdash;when that
old man burnt himself?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> No, father: I was afraid to go near Olympia, on account
of those hateful men I was telling you of; I saw that numbers
of them were going there, to make their barking clamour heard
in the temple, and to abuse all comers. Accordingly I know
nothing of this cremation. But to continue: after I had left
the Brahmins, I went straight to Ethiopia, and thence to Egypt,
where I associated with the priests and prophets, and taught
them of the Gods. Then to Babylon, to instruct the Chaldaeans
and Mages. Next came Scythia, and after Scythia,
Thrace; here Eumolpus and Orpheus were my companions. I
sent them on into Greece before me; Eumolpus, whom I had
thoroughly instructed in theology, was to institute the sacred
mysteries, Orpheus to win men by the power of music. I
followed close behind them. On my first arrival, the Greeks
received me without enthusiasm: they did not, however,
wholly reject my advances; by slow degrees I gained over seven
men to be my companions and disciples, and Samos, Ephesus,
and Abdera,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> each added one to the little company. And then
there sprang up&mdash;I scarce know how&mdash;the tribe of sophists:
men who had but little of my spirit, yet were not wholly
alien to me; a motley Centaur breed, in whom vanity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
wisdom meeting were moulded into one incongruous whole.
They clung not entirely to ignorance, but theirs was not the
steady eye that could meet the gaze of Philosophy; and if at
moments my semblance flashed phantom-like across their dulled
vision, they held that in that dim shadow they had seen all that
was to be seen. It was this pride that nourished the vain, unprofitable
science that they mistook for invincible wisdom;
the science of quaint conceits, ingenious paradoxes, and labyrinthine
dilemmas. My followers would have restrained them,
and exposed their errors: but they grew angry, and conspired
against them, and in the end brought them under the power
of the law, which condemned them to drink of hemlock. Doubtless
I should have done well to renounce humanity there and
then, and take my flight: but Antisthenes and Diogenes, and
after them Crates, and our friend Menippus, prevailed upon
me to tarry yet a little longer. Would that I had never
yielded! I should have been spared much pain in the sequel.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> But, my dear, you are merely giving way to your feelings,
instead of telling me what your wrongs were.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Then hear them, father. There is a vile race upon the
earth, composed for the most part of serfs and menials, creatures
whose occupations have never suffered them to become acquainted
with philosophy; whose earliest years have been spent
in the drudgery of the fields, in learning those base arts for
which they are most fitted&mdash;the fuller's trade, the joiner's, the
cobbler's&mdash;or in carding wool, that housewives may have ease
in their spinning, and the thread be fit for warp and woof.
Thus employed, they knew not in their youth so much as the
name of Philosophy. But they had no sooner reached manhood,
than they perceived the respect paid to my followers; how
men submitted to their blunt speech, valued their advice,
deferred to their judgement, and cowered beneath their censure;
all this they saw, and held that here was a life for a king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
The learning, indeed, that befits a philosopher would have
taken them long to acquire, if it was not utterly out of their
reach. On the other hand, their own miserly handicrafts barely
rewarded their toil with a sufficiency. To some, too, servitude
was in itself an oppression: they knew it, in fact, for the intolerable
thing it is. But they bethought them that there
was still one chance left; their sheet-anchor, as sailors say.
They took refuge with my lady Folly, called in the assistance
of Boldness, Ignorance, and Impudence, ever their untiring
coadjutors, and provided themselves with a stock of bran-new
invectives; these they have ever ready on their tongues; 'tis
their sole equipment; noble provision, is it not, for a philosopher?
Nothing could be more plausible than the philosophic
disguise they now assume, reminding one of the fabled
ass of Cyme, in Aesop, who clothed himself in a lion's skin, and,
stoutly braying, sought to play the lion's part; the beast, I doubt
not, had his adherents. The externals of philosophy, as you know,
are easily aped: it is a simple matter to assume the cloak and
wallet, walk with a stick, and bawl, and bark, and bray, against
all comers. They know that they are safe; their cloth protects
them. Liberty is thus within their grasp: no need to ask their
master's leave; should he attempt to reclaim them, their sticks
are at his service. No more short commons for them now, no
more of crusts whose dryness is mitigated only by herbs or salt
fish: they have choice of meats, drink the best of wines, and
take money where they will, <i>shearing the sheep</i>, as they call it
when they levy contributions, in the certainty that many will
give, from respect to their garb or fear of their tongues. They
foresee, of course, that they will be on the same footing as
genuine philosophers; so long as their exterior is conformable,
no one is likely to make critical distinctions. They take care
not to risk exposure: at the first hint of a rational argument,
they shout their opponent down, withdraw into the stronghold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of personal abuse, and flourish their ever-ready cudgels. Question
their practice, and you will hear much of their principles:
offer to examine those principles, and you are referred to their
conduct. The city swarms with these vermin, particularly with
those who profess the tenets of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and
Crates. Followers of the Dog, they care little to excel in the
canine virtues; they are neither trusty guardians nor affectionate,
faithful servants: but for noise and greed and thievery
and wantonness, for cringing, fawning cupboard-love,&mdash;there,
indeed, they are perfect. Before long you will see every trade
at a standstill, the workmen all at large: for every man of them
knows that, whilst he is bent over his work from morning to
night, toiling and drudging for a starvation wage, idle impostors
are living in the midst of plenty, commanding charity where
they will, with no word of thanks to the giver, and a curse on
him that withholds the gift. Surely (he will say to himself) the
golden age is returned, and the heavens shall rain honey into
my mouth.</p>

<p>And would that that were all! But they have other ways of
bringing discredit upon us, besides the baseness of their origin.
When beauty comes within the reach of these grave and reverend
gentlemen, they are guilty of excesses that I will not pollute
my lips with mentioning. They have been known, like Trojan
Paris, to seduce the wives of their own hosts, and to quote the
authority of Plato for leaving these fair converts at the disposal
of all their acquaintance; they little knew the true meaning of
that inspired philosopher's community of women. I will not
tire you with a description of their drunken orgies; observe,
however, that these are the men who preach against drunkenness
and adultery and avarice and lewdness. Could any contrast
be greater than that presented by their words and their
deeds? They speak their detestation of flattery: a Gnathonides
and a Struthias are less fulsome than they. They bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
men tell the truth: yet their own tongues cannot move but to
utter lies. To hear them, you would say they were at war
with pleasure, and Epicurus their bitterest foe: yet nothing
do they do but for pleasure's sake. Querulous, irritable, passionate
as cradled babes, they are a derision to the beholder; the
veriest trifle serves to move their ire, to bring the purple to
their cheeks, ungoverned fury to their eyes, foam&mdash;call it rather
venom&mdash;to their lips. Preserve me from their turbid rantings!
<i>Gold I ask not, nor silver; be one penny all my wealth, to purchase
beans withal. And for my drink, a river, a spring, shall
furnish me.</i> But presently it turns out that what they want is
not pence, nor shillings, but whole fortunes. He must be
a thriving merchant, whose cargoes will bring him in such
profits as these men suck out of philosophy. They are sufficiently
provided at last, and then off goes the hated uniform:
lands and houses are bought, and soft raiment, and comely
pages. Inquire of them now for Crates's wallet, Antisthenes's
cloak, Diogenes's tub: they know nothing of the matter. When
men see these things, they spit in the face of philosophy; they
think that all philosophers are the same, and blame me their
teacher. It is long since I have won over any to my side.
I toil like Penelope at the loom, and one moment undoes all
that I have done. Ignorance and Wickedness watch my unavailing
labours, and smile.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Really, Philosophy has been shamefully treated. We
must take some measures with these rascals. Let us think what
is to be done. The single stroke of the thunderbolt is too quick
a death.</p>

<p><i>Apol.</i> Father, I have a suggestion to make. By their neglect
of the Muses, these vile quacks have incurred my own resentment
as well as Philosophy's. They are not worthy to die by
your hand. Instead, I would advise your sending Hermes to
them, with full authority to punish them at his discretion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
With his forensic experience, he will be at no loss to distinguish
between the true philosopher and the false. The former will
receive merited praise: on the latter he will inflict such chastisement
as the circumstances demand.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> A sensible proposal. Heracles, you can go too; take
Philosophy with you, and lose no time. Think: this will make
your thirteenth Labour, and a creditable one too, the extermination
of these reptiles.</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> Rather than meddle with them, I would give the
Augean stables a second clean-out. However, let us be starting,
Philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> If I must, I must.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Yes, come along, and we will polish off a few to-day.&mdash;Which
way, Philosophy? You know where they are to be
found. Somewhere in Greece, of course?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Oh no; the few that there are in Greece are genuine
philosophers. Attic poverty is not at all to the liking of the
impostors; we must look for them in places where gold and
silver mines abound.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Straight to Thrace, then?</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> Yes, Thrace, and I will show you the way. I know
every inch of Thrace; I have been there so often. Look here,
this is our route.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Yes?</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> You see those two magnificent mountains (the big one
is Haemus, and the other Rhodope), and the fertile plain that
spreads between them, running to the very foot of either?
Those three grand, rugged crests that stand out so proudly
yonder form as it were a triple citadel to the city that lies
beneath; you can see it now, look.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Superb! A queen among cities; her splendours reach
us even here. And what is the great river that flows so close
beneath the walls?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> The Hebrus, and the city was built by Philip. Well,
we have left the clouds behind us now; let us try our fortune
on <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Very good; and what comes next? How do we hunt
our vermin down?</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> Ah, that is where you come in, Mr. Crier: oblige us
by crying them without loss of time.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> There is only one objection to that: I do not know
what they are called. What names am I to say, Philosophy?
and how shall I describe them?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> I am not sure of their names, as I have never come into
contact with them. To judge from their grasping propensities,
however, you can hardly go wrong with Cteso, Ctesippus,
Ctesicles, Euctemon, Polyctetus<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> To be sure. But who are these men? They seem to
be looking for something too. Why, they are coming up to
speak to us.</p>

<p><i>Innkeeper and Masters.</i> Excuse us, madam, and gentlemen,
but have you come across a company of three rascals conducting
a woman&mdash;a very masculine-looking female, with hair cut short
in the Spartan fashion?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Ha! the very people we are looking for!</p>

<p><i>Masters.</i> Indeed, madam? But these are three runaway
slaves. The woman was kidnapped by them, and we want to
get her back.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> <i>Our</i> business with them I will tell you afterwards.
For the present, let us make a joint proclamation.</p>

<p>Disappeared. A Paphlagonian slave, formerly of Sinope.
Any person giving information as to his whereabouts will be
rewarded; the amount of the reward to be fixed by the informant.
Description. Name: begins with CTE. Complexion:
sallow. Hair: close-cropped, with long beard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>Dress: a coarse cloak with wallet. Temper: bad. Education:
none. Voice: harsh. Manner: offensive.</p>

<p><i>First Master.</i> Why, what is all this about? His name used
to be Cantharus when he was with me. He had long hair, and
no beard, and was apprenticed to my trade; I am a fuller, and
he was in my shop, dressing cloth.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Yes, it is the same; but he has dressed to some purpose
this time, and has become a philosopher.</p>

<p><i>First Master.</i> Cantharus a philosopher! I like that. And
where do I come in?</p>

<p><i>Second and Third Masters.</i> Oh well, we shall get them all
now. This lady knows all about them, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Heracles, who is this comely person with a lyre?</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> It is Orpheus. I was on the Argo with him. He was
the best of boatswains; it was quite a pleasure to row to his
singing. Welcome, my musical friend: you have not forgotten
Heracles, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Or.</i> And welcome to all of you, Philosophy, Heracles,
Hermes. I should like my reward, please: I can lay my finger
on your man.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Then show us the way. It is useless, of course, to offer
gold to the gifted son of Calliope?</p>

<p><i>Or.</i> Oh, quite.&mdash;I will show you the house, but not the man.
His tongue might avenge him; scurrility is his strong point.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Lead on.</p>

<p><i>Or.</i> It is this house close by. And now I shall leave you;
I have no wish to set eyes on him.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Hush! Was that a woman's voice, reciting Homer?</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> It was. Let us listen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Innkeeper's Wife.</i> More than the gates of Hell I hate that man<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Her.</i> At that rate, madam, you will have to quarrel with
Cantharus:</p>

<p class="center">He with his kindly host hath dealt amiss.
</p>

<p><i>Innkeeper.</i> That's me. I took him in, and he ran away with
my wife.</p>

<span class="i0">And lion&mdash;doth a blasting fury breathe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Innkeeper.</i> Wife, wife! the dogs have been too many for
you; ay, and for your virtue, so men say.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Hope for the best; some little Cerberus or Geryon
shall call you father, and Heracles have employment again.&mdash;Ah,
no need to knock: here they come.</p>

<p><i>First Master.</i> Ha, Cantharus, have I got you? What, nothing
to say for yourself? Let us see what you have in that wallet;
beans, no doubt, or a crust of bread.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Bread, indeed! Gold, a purseful of it!</p>

<p><i>Hera.</i> That need not surprise you. In Greece, you see, he
was a Cynic, but here he is all for golden Chrysippus. Next
you will see him dangling, Cleanthes-like<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, by his beard, and
serve the dirty fellow right.</p>

<p><i>Second Master.</i> Ha, you rascal there, am I mistaken, or are
you my lost Lecythio? Lecythio it is. What a figure! Lecythio
a philosopher! I'll believe anything after this.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Does none of you know anything about this other?</p>

<p><i>Third Master.</i> Oh yes, he is mine; but he may go hang
for me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Her.</i> And why is that?</p>

<p><i>Third Master.</i> Ah, he's a sadly leaky vessel, is Rosolio, as we
used to call him.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Gracious Heracles! did you hear that? Rosolio with
wallet and stick!&mdash;Friend, here is your wife again.</p>

<p><i>Innkeeper.</i> Thank you for nothing. I'll have no woman
brought to bed of an old book in my house.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> How am I to understand that?</p>

<p><i>Innkeeper.</i> Why, the Three-headed Dog is a book, master?</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> Ay, and so was the Man with the Three Hats, for that
matter.</p>

<p><i>Masters.</i> We leave the rest to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> This is my judgement. Let the woman return beneath
her husband's roof, or many-headed monsters will come of it.
These two truant sparks I hand over to their owners: let them
follow their trades as heretofore; Lecythio wash clothes, and
Rosolio patch them;&mdash;not, however, before his back has felt
the mallow-stalk. And for Cantharus, first let the men of
pitch take him, and plaster him without mercy; and be their
pitch the vilest procurable. Then let him be led forth to
stand upon the snowy slopes of Haemus, naked and fettered.</p>

<p><i>Can.</i> Mercy! have mercy on me! Ah me! I am undone!</p>

<p><i>First Master.</i> So tragic? Come, follow me to the plasterers;
and off with that lion's-skin, lest you be taken for other than
an ass.</p>

<h2>SATURNALIA</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Cronus. His Priest</i>
</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Cronus, you are in authority just now, I understand; to
you our sacrifices and ceremonies are directed; now, what can
I make surest of getting if I ask it of you at this holy season?</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> You had better make up your own mind what to pray
for, unless you expect your ruler to be a <i>clairvoyant</i> and know
what you would like to ask. Then, I will do my best not to
disappoint you.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Oh, I have done that long ago. No originality about it;
the usual thing, please,&mdash;wealth, plenty of gold, landed proprietorship,
a train of slaves, gay soft raiment, silver, ivory, in
fact everything that is worth anything. Best of Cronuses, give
me some of these; your priest should profit by your rule, and
not be the one man who has to go without all his life.</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Of course! <i>ultra vires</i>; these are not mine to give. So
do not sulk at being refused; ask Zeus for them; he will be in
authority again soon enough. Mine is a limited monarchy, you
see. To begin with, it only lasts a week; that over, I am a
private person, just a man in the street. Secondly, during my
week the serious is barred; no business allowed. Drinking and
being drunk, noise and games and dice, appointing of kings and
feasting of slaves, singing naked, clapping of tremulous hands,
an occasional ducking of corked faces in icy water,&mdash;such are the
functions over which I preside. But the great things, wealth
and gold and such, Zeus distributes as he will.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> He is not very free with them, though, Cronus. I am
tired of asking for them, as I do at the top of my voice. He
never listens; he shakes his aegis, gets the thunderbolt ready
for action, puts on a stern look, and scares you out of worrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
him. He does consent now and then, and make a man rich;
but his selection is most casual; he will pass over the good and
sensible, and set fools and knaves up to the lips in wealth, gaol-birds
or debauchees most of them. But I want to know what
are the things <i>you</i> can do.</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Oh, they are not to be sneezed at; it does not come to
so very little, if you make allowance for my general limitations.
Perhaps you think it a trifle always to win at dice, and be able
to count on the sice when the ace is the best the others can
throw? Anyhow, there are plenty who get as much as they
can eat just because the die likes them and does what it can
for them. Others you may see naked, swimming for their lives;
and what was the reef that wrecked them, pray? that little
die. Or again, to enjoy your wine, to sing the best song at
table, at the slaves' feast to see the other waiters[1] ducked for
incompetence, while you are acclaimed victor and carry off the
sausage prize,&mdash;is all that nothing? Or you find yourself absolute
monarch by favour of the knucklebone, can have no ridiculous
commands<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> laid on you, and can lay them on the rest:
one must shout out a libel on himself, another dance naked, or
pick up the flute-girl and carry her thrice round the house;
how is that for a sample of my open-handedness? If you
complain that the sovereignty is not real nor lasting, that is
unreasonable of you; you see that I, the giver of it, have a
short-lived tenure myself. Well, anything that is in my power&mdash;draughts,
monarchy, song, and the rest I have mentioned&mdash;you
can ask, and welcome; <i>I</i> will not scare you with aegis and
thunderbolt.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Most kind Titan, such gifts I require not of you. Give
me the answer that was my first desire, and then count yourself
to have repaid my sacrifice sufficiently; you shall have my
receipt in full.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Cro.</i> Put your question. An answer you shall have, if my
knowledge is equal to it.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> First, then, is the common story true? used you to eat
the children Rhea bore you? and did she steal away Zeus, and
give you a stone to swallow for a baby? did he when he grew
to manhood make victorious war upon you and drive you from
your kingdom, bind and cast you into Tartarus, you and all the
powers that ranged themselves with you?</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Fellow, were it any but this festive season, when 'tis
lawful to be drunken, and slaves have licence to revile their
lords, the reward for thy question, for this thy rudeness to
a grey-haired aged God, had been the knowledge that wrath is
yet permitted me.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> It is not <i>my</i> story, you know, Cronus; it is Homer's and
Hesiod's; I might say, only I don't quite like to, that it is the
belief of the generality.</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> That conceited shepherd<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>? you do not suppose he knew
anything worth knowing about me? Why, think. Is a man
conceivable&mdash;let alone a God&mdash;who would devour his own children?&mdash;wittingly,
I mean; of course he might be a Thyestes
and have a wicked brother; that is different. However, even
granting that, I ask you whether he could help knowing he had
a stone in his mouth instead of a baby; I envy him his teeth,
that is all. The fact is, there was no war, and Zeus did not
depose me; I voluntarily abdicated and retired from the cares
of office. That I am not in fetters or in Tartarus you can see
for yourself, or you must be as blind as Homer.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> But what possessed you to abdicate?</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Well, the long and short of it is, as I grew old and gouty&mdash;that
last, by the way, accounts for the fetters of the story&mdash;I
found the men of these latter days getting out of hand; I had
to be for ever running up and down swinging the thunderbolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and blasting perjurers, temple-robbers, oppressors; I could get
no peace; younger blood was wanted. So I had the happy
thought of abdicating in Zeus's favour. Independently of that,
I thought it a good thing to divide up my authority&mdash;I had
sons to take it on&mdash;and to have a pleasant easy time, free of all
the petition business and the embarrassment of contradictory
prayers, no thundering or lightening to do, no lamentable
necessity for sending discharges of hail. None of that now;
I am on the shelf, and I like it, sipping neat nectar and talking
over old times with Iapetus and the others that were boys with
me. And He is king, and has troubles by the thousand. But
it occurred to me to reserve these few days for the employments
I have mentioned; during them I resume my authority, that
men may remember what life was like in my days, when all
things grew without sowing or ploughing of theirs&mdash;no ears of
corn, but loaves complete and meat ready cooked&mdash;, when wine
flowed in rivers, and there were fountains of milk and honey;
all men were good and all men were gold. Such is the purpose
of this my brief reign; therefore the merry noise on every side,
the song and the games; therefore the slave and the free as
one. When I was king, slavery was not.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Dear me, now! and I accounted for your kindness to
slaves and prisoners from the story again; I thought that, as
you were a slave yourself, you were paying slaves a compliment
in memory of your own fetters.</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Cease your ribald jests.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Quite so; I will. But here is another question, please.
Used mortals to play draughts in your time?</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Surely; but not for hundreds or thousands of pounds
like you; nuts were their highest stake; a man might lose
without a sigh or a tear, when losing could not mean starvation.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Wise men! though, as they were solid gold themselves,
they were out of temptation. It occurred to me when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
mentioned that&mdash;suppose any one were to import one of your
solid gold men into our age and exhibit him, what sort of
a reception would the poor thing get? They would tear him
to pieces, not a doubt of it. I see them rushing at him like
the Maenads at Pentheus, the Thracian women at Orpheus,
or his hounds at Actaeon, trying which could get the biggest
bit of him; even in the holidays they do not forget their avarice;
most of them regard the holy season as a sort of harvest. In
which persuasion some of them loot their friends' tables, others
complain, quite unreasonably, of you, or smash their innocent
dice in revenge for losses due to their own folly.</p>

<p>But tell me this, now: as you are such a delicate old deity,
why pick out the most disagreeable time, when all is wrapt in
snow, and the north wind blows, everything is hard frozen,
trees dry and bare and leafless, meadows have lost their flowery
beauty, and men are hunched up cowering over the fire like so
many octogenarians,&mdash;why this season of all others for your
festival? It is no time for the old or the luxurious.</p>

<p><i>Cro.</i> Fellow, your questions are many, and no good substitute
for the flowing bowl. You have filched a good portion
of my carnival with your impertinent philosophizings. Let
them go, and we will make merry and clap our hands and take
our holiday licence, play draughts for nuts in the good old
way, elect our kings and do them fealty. I am minded to verify
the saw, that old age is second childhood.</p>

<p><i>Pr.</i> Now dry be his cup when he thirsts, to whom such words
come amiss! Cronus, a bowl with you! 'tis enough that you
have made answer to my former questions. By the way, I
think of reducing our little interview to writing, my questions
and your so affable answers, for submission to those friends
whose discretion may be trusted.</p>

<h2>CRONOSOLON</h2>


<p><i>The words of Cronosolon, priest and prophet of Cronus, and
holiday lawgiver.</i></p>

<p>The regulations to be observed by the poor I have sent
expressly to them in another scroll, and am well assured
that they will abide by the same, failing which, they will be
obnoxious to the heavy penalties enacted against the disobedient.
And you, ye rich, see to it that ye transgress not nor disregard
the instructions following. Be it known to him that shall so do,
that he scorneth not me the lawgiver, but Cronus' self, who
hath appeared, in no dream, but these two days gone to my
waking senses, and appointed me to give holiday laws. No
bondsman was he, nor foul to look upon, as painters have
limned him after poets' foolish tales. His sickle was indeed
full sharp; but he was cheerful of countenance, strong of limb,
and royally arrayed. Such was his semblance; and his words,
wherein too was divinity, it is fitting you hear.</p>

<p>He beheld me pacing downcast, meditative, and straightway
knew&mdash;as how should a God not know?&mdash;the cause of my
sorrow, and how I was ill content with poverty and with the
unseasonable thinness of my raiment. For there was frost and
north wind and ice and snow, and I but ill fenced against them.
The feast was moreover at hand, and I might see others making
ready for sacrifice and good cheer, but for me things looked
not that way. He came upon me from behind and touched
and thrilled my ear, as is the manner of his approach, and spake:
'O Cronosolon, wherefore this troubled mien?' 'Is there not a
cause, lord,' I said, 'when I look on pestilent loathly fellows
passing rich, engrossing all luxury, but I and many another skilled
in liberal arts have want and trouble to our bed-fellows? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
thou, even thou, lord, wilt not say it shall not be, nor order
things anew and make us equal.' 'In common life,' then said
he, ''tis no light matter to change the lots that Clotho and her
sister Fates have laid upon you; but as touching the feast,
I will set right your poverty; and let the settling be after this
manner. Go, O Cronosolon, indite me certain laws for observance
in the feast days, that the rich feast not by themselves,
but impart of their good things to you.' Then said I, 'I know
not how.'</p>

<p>'But I,' quoth he, 'will teach you.' And therewith he began
and taught me. And when I was perfect, 'And certify them,'
he said, 'that if they do not hereafter, this sharp sickle that
I bear is no toy; 'twere odd if I could maim therewith Uranus
my father, but not do as much for the rich that transgress my
laws; they shall be fitted to serve the Mother of the Gods
with alms-box and pipe and timbrel.' Thus he threatened;
wherefore ye will do well to observe his decrees.</p>


<h3>FIRST TABLE OF THE LAWS</h3>

<p>All business, be it public or private, is forbidden during the
feast days, save such as tends to sport and solace and delight.
Let none follow their avocations saving cooks and bakers.</p>

<p>All men shall be equal, slave and free, rich and poor, one with
another.</p>

<p>Anger, resentment, threats, are contrary to law.</p>

<p>During the feast days, no man shall be called to account of
his stewardship.</p>

<p>No man shall in these days count his money nor inspect his
wardrobe, nor make an inventory.</p>

<p>Athletic training shall cease.</p>

<p>No discourse shall be either composed or delivered, except
it be witty and lusty, conducing to mirth and jollity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECOND TABLE OF THE LAWS</h3>

<p>In good time against the feast every rich man shall inscribe
in a table-book the names of his several friends, and shall provide
money to a tithe of his yearly incomings, together with the
superfluity of his raiment, and such ware as is too coarse for his
own service, and a goodly quantity of silver vessels. These shall
be all in readiness.</p>

<p>On the eve of the feast the rich shall hold a purification, and
drive forth from their houses parsimony and avarice and covetousness
and all other such leanings that dwell with the most of
them. And their houses being purged they shall make offering
to Zeus the Enricher, and to Hermes the Giver, and to Apollo
the Generous. And at afternoon the table-book of their friends
shall be read to them.</p>

<p>Then shall they with their own hands allot to each friend his
fitting share, and send it before set of sun.</p>

<p>And the carriers shall be not more than three or four, the
trustiest of a man's servants, and well on in years. And let
him write in a letter what is the gift, and its amount, that the
carriers be not suspect to giver or receiver. And the said
servants shall drink one cup each man, and depart, and ask
no more.</p>

<p>To such as have culture let all be sent in double measure;
it is fitting that they have two portions.</p>

<p>The message that goeth with a gift shall be modest and brief;
let no man humble his friend, nor commend his own gift.</p>

<p>Rich shall not send gifts to rich, nor entertain his peer at
the feast.</p>

<p>Of the things made ready for sending, none shall be reserved;
let no man give and un-give.</p>

<p>He that by absence missed his share of yester-year shall now
receive that too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Let the rich discharge debts for their friends that are poor,
and their rent if they owe and cannot pay it.</p>

<p>Let it be their care above all to know in time the needs of
every man.</p>

<p>The receiver for his part should be not over-curious, but
account great whatsoever is sent him. Yet are a flask of wine,
a hare, or a fat fowl, not to be held sufficient gifts; rather they
bring the feast into mockery. For the poor man's return gift,
if he have learning, let it be an ancient book, but of good omen
and festive humour, or a writing of his own after his ability;
and the rich man shall receive the same with a glad countenance,
and take and read it forthwith; if he reject or fling it aside, be
it known to him that he hath incurred that penalty of the sickle,
though he himself hath sent all he should. For the unlearned,
let him send a garland or grains of frankincense.</p>

<p>If a poor man send, to one that is rich, raiment or silver or
gold beyond his means, the gift shall be impounded and sold,
and the price thereof cast into the treasury of Cronus; and on
the morrow the poor man shall receive from the rich stripes
upon his hands with a rod not less than twelve score and ten.</p>


<h3>LAWS OF THE BOARD</h3>

<p>The bath hour shall be noon, and before it nuts and draughts.</p>

<p>Every man shall take place as chance may direct; dignities
and birth and wealth shall give no precedence.</p>

<p>All shall be served with the same wine; the rich host shall not
say, For my colic, or for my megrims, I must drink the better.</p>

<p>Every man's portion of meat shall be alike. The attendants
shall favour none, nor yet in their serving shall they be deaf to
any, nor pass any by before his pleasure be known. They shall
not set great portions before him, and small before him,
nor give this one a dainty and that one refuse, but all shall be
equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Let the butler have a quick eye and ear for all from his point
of vantage, and heed his master least. And be the cups large or
small at choice.</p>

<p>It shall be any man's right to call a health; and let all drink
to all if they will, when the host has set the wine a-going. But
no man shall be bound to drink, if he be no strong toper.</p>

<p>It shall not be free to any who will to bring an unpractised
dancer or musician to the dinner.</p>

<p>Let the limit to jesting be, that the feelings of none be
wounded.</p>

<p>The stake at draughts shall be nuts alone; if any play for
money, he shall fast on the morrow.</p>

<p>When the rich man shall feast his slaves, let his friends
serve with him.</p>

<p>These laws every rich man shall engrave on a brazen pillar
and set them in the centre of his hall and there read them.
And be it known that, so long as that pillar stands, neither
famine nor sickness nor fire nor any mischance shall come upon
the house. But if it be removed&mdash;which God avert!&mdash;then
evil shall be that house's doom.</p>

<h2>SATURNALIAN LETTERS</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><i>I to Cronus, Greeting.</i></p>

<p>I have written to you before telling you of my condition,
how poverty was likely to exclude me from the festival you have
proclaimed. I remember observing how unreasonable it was
that some of us should be in the lap of wealth and luxury, and
never give a share of their good things to the poor, while others
are dying of hunger with your holy season just upon them.
But as you did not answer, I thought I might as well refresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
your memory. Dear good Cronus, you ought really to remove
this inequality and pool all the good things before telling us to
make merry. The world is peopled with camels and ants now,
nothing between the two. Or, to put it another way, kindly
imagine an actor, with one foot mounted on the tragic stilt and
the other bare; if he walks like that, he must be a giant or
a dwarf according to the leg he stands on; our lives are about
as equal as his heights. Those who are taken on by manager
Fortune and supplied with stilts come the hero over us, while
the rest pad it on the ground, though you may take my word
for it we could rant and stalk with the best of them if we were
given the same chance.</p>

<p>Now the poets inform me that in the old days when you
were king it was otherwise with men; earth bestowed her gifts
upon them unsown and unploughed, every man's table was
spread automatically, rivers ran wine and milk and honey.
Most wonderful of all, the men themselves were gold, and
poverty never came near them. As for us, we can hardly pass
for lead; some yet meaner material must be found. In the
sweat of our face the most of us eat bread. Poverty, distress, and
helplessness, sighs and lamentations and pinings for what is not,
such is the staple of man's life, the poor man's at least. All
which, believe me, would be much less painful to us, if there
were not the felicity of the rich to emphasize it. They have their
chests of gold and silver, their stored wardrobes, their slaves
and carriages and house property and farms, and, not content
with keeping to themselves their superfluity in all these, they
will scarce fling a glance to the generality of us.</p>

<p>Ah, Cronus, there is the sting that rankles beyond endurance&mdash;that
one should loll on cloth of finest purple, overload his
stomach with all delicacies, and keep perpetual feast with guests
to wish him joy, while I and my like dream over the problematic
acquisition of a sixpence to provide us a loaf white or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
brown, and send us to bed with a smack of cress or thyme or
onion in our mouths. Now, good Cronus, either reform this
altogether and feed us alike, or at the least induce the rich not
to enjoy their good things alone; from their bushels of gold
let them scatter a poor pint among us; the raiment that they
would never feel the loss of though the moth were to consume
it utterly, seeing that in any case it must perish by mere lapse
of time, let them devote to covering our nakedness rather than
to propagating mildew in their chests and drawers.</p>

<p>Further let them entertain us by fours and fives, and not as
they now do, but more on principles of equality; let us all
share alike. The way now is for one to gorge himself on some
dainty, keeping the servant waiting about him till he is pleased
to have done; but when it reaches us, as we are in the act of
helping ourselves it is whisked off, and we have but that fleeting
glimpse of the entr&eacute;e or fag-end of a sweet. Or in comes
a sucking-pig; half of it, including the head, falls to the host;
the rest of us share the bones, slightly disguised. And pray
charge the butlers not to make us call unto seven times, but
bring us our wine when we ask for it first; and let it be a full-sized
cup and a bumper, as it is for their masters. And the
same wine, please, for every one at table; where is the legal
authority for my host's growing mellow on the choicest bouquet
while my stomach is turned with mere must?</p>

<p>These things if you correct and reform, you will have made
life life, and your feast a feast. If not, we will leave the feasting
to them, and just kneel down and pray that as they come from
the bath the slave may knock down and spill their wine, the
cook smoke their sauce and absent-mindedly pour the pea-soup
over the caviare, the dog steal in while the scullions are busy
and make away with the whole of the sausage and most of the
pastry. Boar and buck and sucking-pigs, may they rival in
their roasting Homer's oxen of the Sun! only let them not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
confine themselves to crawling<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, but jump up and make off to
the mountains with their spits sticking in them! and may the
fat fowls, all plucked and trussed, fly far away and rob them of
their unsociable delights!</p>

<p>But we can touch them more closely than that. May Indian
gold-ants<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> come by night, unearth their hoards and convey
them to their own state treasury! May their wardrobe-keepers
be negligent, and our good friends the mice make sieve-work
of their raiment, fit for nothing but tunny-nets! May
every pretty curled minion, every Hyacinth and Achilles and
Narcissus they keep, turn bald as he hands the cup! let his hair
fall off and his chin grow bristly, till he is like the peak-bearded
fellows on the comic stage, hairy and prickly on cheek and
temple, and on the top smooth and bare! These are specimens
of the petitions we will send up, if they will not moderate their
selfishness, acknowledge themselves trustees for the public, and
let us have our fair share.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p><i>Cronus to his well-beloved me, Greeting.</i></p>

<p>My good man, why this absurdity of writing to me about the
state of the world, and advising redistribution of property? It
is none of my business; the present ruler must see to that. It
is an odd thing you should be the only person unaware that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>I have long abdicated; my sons now administer various
departments, of which the one that concerns you is mainly in
the hands of Zeus; my own charge is confined to draughts
and merry-making, song and good cheer, and that for one week
only. As for the weightier matters you speak of, removal of
inequalities and reducing of all men to one level of poverty or
riches, Zeus must do your business for you. On the other
hand, if any man is wronged or defrauded of his holiday privileges,
that is a matter within my competence; and I am writing
to the rich on the subject of dinners, and that pint of gold, and
the raiment, directing them to send you what the season requires.
The poor are reasonable there; it is right and proper for the
rich to do these things, unless it turns out that they have good
reasons to the contrary.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, however, I must tell you that you are all
in error; it is quite a misconception to imagine the rich in
perfect bliss; they have no monopoly of life's pleasures because
they can eat expensive food, drink too much good wine, revel in
beauty, and go in soft raiment. You have no idea of how it
works out. The resulting anxieties are very considerable. A
ceaseless watch must be kept, or stewards will be lazy and dishonest,
wine go sour, and grain be weeviled; the burglar will
be off with the rich man's plate; agitators will persuade the
people that he is meditating a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. And these are but
a minute fraction of their troubles; if you could know their
apprehensions and cares, you would think riches a thing to be
avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>Why, look at me; if wealth and dominion were good things,
do you suppose I should have been fool enough to relinquish
them, make room for others, and sit down like a common man
content with a subordinate position? No, it was because I
knew all the conditions the rich and powerful cannot escape
that I had the sense to abdicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>You made a great fuss in your letter about <i>their</i> gorging on
boar's head and pastry while <i>your</i> festival consists of a mouthful
of cress or thyme or onion. Now, what are the facts? As
to the immediate sensation, on the palate, there is little to
choose between the two diets&mdash;not much to complain of in
either; but with the after effects it is quite otherwise. <i>You</i>
get up next morning without either the headache the rich
man's wine leaves behind, or the disgusting queasiness that
results from his surfeit of food. To these effects he adds
those of nights given to lust and debauchery, and as likely as
not reaps the fruit of his luxury in consumption, pneumonia,
or dropsy. It is quite a difficult matter to find a rich man who
is not deathly pale; most of them by the time they are old men
use eight legs belonging to other people instead of their own
two; they are gold without and rags within, like the stage
hero's robes. No fish dinners for you, I admit; you hardly
know what fish tastes like; but then observe, no gout or pneumonia
either, nor other ailments due to other excesses. Apart
from that, though, the rich themselves do not enjoy their daily
over-indulgence in these things; you may see them as eager,
and more, for a dinner of herbs as ever you are for game.</p>

<p>I say nothing of their other vexations&mdash;one has a disreputable
son, another a wife who prefers his slave to himself, another
realizes that his minion yields to necessity what he would not
to affection; there are numberless things, in fact, that you
know nothing about; you only see their gold and purple, or
catch sight of them behind their high-steppers, and open your
mouths and abase yourselves before them. If you left them
severely alone, if you did not turn to stare at their silver-plated
carriages, if you did not while they were talking eye their
emerald rings, or finger their clothes and admire the fineness
of the texture, if you let them keep their riches to themselves,
in short, I can assure you they would seek you out and implore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the favour of your company; you see, they <i>must</i> show you their
couches and tables and goblets, the sole good of which is in the
being known to possess them.</p>

<p>You will find that most of their acquisitions are made for
you; they are not for their own use, but for your astonishment.
I am one that knows both lives, and I write this for your consolation.
You should keep the feast with the thought in your
minds that both parties will soon leave this earthly scene, they
resigning their wealth, and you your poverty. However, I will
write to them as I promised, and am confident that they will not
disregard what I say.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p><i>Cronus to the Rich, Greeting.</i></p>

<p>I lately received a letter from the poor, complaining that you
give them no share of your prosperity. They petitioned me in
general terms to institute community of goods and let each
have his part: it was only right that equality should be established,
instead of one's having a superfluity while another was
cut off from pleasure altogether. I told them that had better
be left to Zeus; but their particular festival grievances I considered
to belong to my own jurisdiction, and so I undertook to
write to you. These demands of theirs are moderate enough,
it seems to me. How can we possibly keep the feast (they ask),
when we are numb with frost and pinched with hunger? if
I meant them to participate, I must compel you to bestow on
them any clothes that you do not require, or find too heavy for
your own use, and also to vouchsafe them just a slight sprinkling
of gold. If you do this, they engage not to dispute your right
to your property any further in the court of Zeus. Otherwise
they will demand redistribution the next time he takes his seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
upon the bench. Well, this is no heavy call, considering
the vast property on the possession of which I congratulate
you.</p>

<p>They also requested me to mention the subject of dinners;
you were to ask them to dinner, instead of closing your doors
and living daintily by yourselves. When you do entertain
a few of them at long intervals, they say you make it rather
a humiliation than an enjoyment; everything is done to degrade
them&mdash;that monstrous piece of snobbishness, for instance, the
giving different people different wines. It is really a little discreditable
to them that they do not get up and walk out in
such a case, leaving you in sole possession. But that is not all;
they tell me there is not <i>enough</i> to drink either; your butlers'
ears are as impervious as those of Odysseus's crew. Other
vulgarities I can hardly bring myself to name. The helpings
and the waiters are complained of; the latter linger about you
till you are full to repletion, but post by your poor guests at
a run&mdash;with other meannesses hardly conceivable in the house
of a gentleman. For mirth and good-fellowship it is essential
that all the company be on the same footing; if your carver
does not secure equality, better not have one, but a general
scramble.</p>

<p>It rests with you to obviate these complaints and secure
honour and affection; a liberality that costs you nothing
appreciable will impress itself permanently by its timeliness on
the memory of recipients. Why, your cities would not be
habitable, if you had not poor fellow citizens to make their
numberless contributions to your well-being; you would have
no admirers of your wealth if you lived alone with it in the
obscurity of isolation. Let there be plenty to see it and to
marvel at your silver and your exquisite tables; let them drink
to your health, and as they drink examine the goblet, feel and
guess at its weight, enjoy its storied workmanship enhanced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and enhancing the preciousness of the material. So you may
not only gain a reputation for goodness and geniality, but also
escape envy; that is a feeling not directed against people
who let others participate in their prosperity to a reasonable
extent; every one prays that they may live long to enjoy
it. Your present practice results in an unsatisfying life, with
none to see your happiness, but plenty to grudge you your
wealth.</p>

<p>It is surely not so agreeable to gorge yourself alone, like a lion
or an old wolf that has deserted the pack, as to have the company
of well-bred people who do their best to make things
pleasant. In the first place they banish dull silence from your
table, and are ready with a good story, a harmless jest, or some
other contribution to entertainment; that is the way to please
the Gods of wine and love and beauty. And secondly they win
you love by spreading abroad next morning your hospitable
fame. These are things that would be cheap at a considerable
price.</p>

<p>For I put it to you whether, if blindness were a regular concomitant
of poverty (fancy is free), you would be indifferent to
the want of any one to impress with your purple clothes and
attendant crowds and massive rings. I will not dwell on the
certainty that plots and ill-feeling will be excited against you by
your exclusiveness; suffice it to say that the curses they threaten
to imprecate upon you are positively horrible; God forbid they
should really be driven to it! You would never taste sausage
or pastry more; if the dog's depredations stopped short of
completeness, you would still find a fishy flavour in your soup,
the boar and the buck would effect an escape to the mountains
from off the very roasting-jack, and your birds (no matter for
their being plucked) would be off with a whiz and a whirr to
the poor men's tables. Worst of all, your pretty cup-bearers
would turn bald in a twinkling&mdash;the wine, by the way, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
previously all been spilt. I now leave you to make up your
minds on the course that the festival proprieties and your
own safety recommend; these people are extremely poor; a
little relief will gain you friends worth having at a trifling cost.</p>

<p class="right">H.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p><i>The Rich to Cronus, Greeting.</i></p>

<p>Do you really suppose, Sire, that these letters of the poor
have gone exclusively to <i>your</i> address? Zeus is quite deaf
with their clamour, their appeals for redistribution, their complaints
of Destiny for her unfairness and of us for refusing them
relief. But Zeus is Zeus; <i>he</i> knows where the fault lies, and
consequently pays them very little attention. However, as the
authority is at present with you, to you we will address our
defence. Having before our eyes all that you have laid down
on the beauty of assisting out of our abundance those who are
in want, and the delight of associating and making merry with
the poor, we adopted the principle of treating them on such
equal terms that a guest could not possibly have anything to
complain of.</p>

<p>On their side, they started with professions of wanting very
little indeed; but that was only the thin edge of the wedge.
Now, if their demands are not instantly and literally satisfied,
there is bad temper and offence and talk; their tales may be as
false as they will, every one believes them: they have been
there; they must know! Our only choice was between a
refusal that meant detestation, and a total surrender that
meant speedy ruin and transfer to the begging class for ourselves.</p>

<p>But the worst is to come. At table that filling of the stomach
(of which we have by no means the monopoly) does not so com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>pletely
occupy them but that, when they have drunk a drop
too much, they find time for familiarities with the attendants
or saucy compliments to the ladies. Then, after being ill at
our tables, they go home, and next day reproach us with the
hunger and thirst they feelingly describe. If you doubt the
accuracy of this account, we refer you to your own quondam
guest Ixion, who being hospitably received by you and treated
as one of yourselves distinguished himself by his drunken
addresses to Hera.</p>

<p>For these among other reasons we determined to protect
ourselves by giving them the entr&eacute;e no longer. But if they
engage under your guarantee to make only the moderate demands
they now profess, and to abstain from outraging
their hosts' feelings, what is ours shall be theirs; we shall be
only too glad of their company. We will comply with your
suggestions about the clothes and, as far as may be, about the
gold, and in fact will do our duty. We ask them on their side
to give up trading on our hospitality, and to be our friends
instead of our toadies and parasites. If only they will behave
themselves, you shall have no reason to complain of us.</p>

<h2>A FEAST OF LAPITHAE</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Philo. Lycinus</i>
</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Ah, Lycinus, I hear you had a very varied entertainment
dining with Aristaenetus last night; a philosophic debate
followed by a sharp difference of opinion, I understand; if
Charinus's information was correct, it went as far as blows,
and the conference had a bloody end.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Charinus? he was not there; what can he know about
it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Dionicus the doctor had told him, he said; <i>he</i> was one
of you, was he not?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes, but only later on; he came when the fray was already
a promising one, though no blows had yet been struck. I doubt
whether he could have any intelligible account to give, as he had
not followed the beginning of the rivalry that was to end in
bloodshed.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Just so; Charinus told me to apply to you, if I wanted
a true description of all the details. Dionicus had mentioned
that he had not been there all through, but said you knew the
whole of the facts, and would remember the arguments too, as
you are a real student and take more than an outside interest
in that sort of thing. So no more ceremony, please, but spread
me this most tempting of banquets; its attractions are enhanced
by the fact that we shall enjoy it soberly, quietly, without
bloodshed or danger, whatever regrettable words or deeds the
old men's weak heads or the young men's vinous exaltation may
have led them into.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> What an indiscreet demand, Philo! What, make the
story public? give a full description of what men do in their
cups? A veil should be drawn over such things; they should
be ascribed to Dionysus; I am not at all sure that he will
pardon the man who holds aloof from his mystic influence.
I should like to be sure that it does not betray an evil nature
if you dwell too curiously on what you should forget as you
leave the dining-room. 'Babble wet, But dry forget,' goes the
rhyme. It was not right of Dionicus to blab to Charinus,
bespattering great philosophers with stale wine-rinsings. No,
get thee behind me; my lips are sealed.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Coquette! and you have mistaken your man too; I am
quite aware that you are more eager to tell than I to hear;
I believe, if you had no one to listen, you would find a pillar or
statue and out with the whole tale to it in one torrent. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
I try to make off now, you will never let me go till I have done
my listening; you will hold on to me and pursue me and solicit
me. Then it will be my turn to coquet. Oh, very well; do
not trouble to tell me; good-bye; I will get it out of some
one else.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh, you needn't be so hasty. I will tell you, if you are
so set upon it; only don't repeat it to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> If I know anything whatever of you, you will take good
care of that; you will not leave me many to repeat it to.</p>

<p>Now begin with telling me what Aristaenetus was giving the
banquet for; was it his boy Zeno's wedding?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No, his girl Cleanthis's&mdash;to the son of Eucritus the
banker, a student of philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> I know; a fine lad; only a lad, though; old enough to
marry?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, he was the most <i>suitable</i> to be had, I suppose. He
is a well-behaved youngster, has taken up philosophy, and is
sole heir to a rich father; so he was the selected bridegroom.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Ah, no doubt Eucritus's money is a consideration. Well,
and who were the guests?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, I need not give you the whole list; what you want
is the philosophers and men of letters. There was the old
Stoic Zenothemis, and with him 'Labyrinth' Diphilus; Aristaenetus's
son Zeno is his pupil. The Peripatetics were represented
by Cleodemus&mdash;the ready, argumentative person&mdash;you
know him; 'Sword,' and 'Cleaver,' his disciples call him. And
then there was Hermon the Epicurean; directly he came in,
there were queer looks and edgings away in the Stoic contingent;
he might have been a parricide or an outlaw, by the way they
treated him. These had been asked as Aristaenetus's personal
friends and intimates, under which head come also Histiaeus the
literary man and Dionysodorus the rhetorician.</p>

<p>Then Chaereas (that is the bridegroom's name) was responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
for his tutor Ion the Platonic&mdash;a grave reverend man
remarkable for the composure of his expression. He is generally
spoken of as 'The Standard,' so infallible is his judgement. As
he walked up the room, everybody got out of his way and
saluted him like some higher being; the great Ion's presence is
like an angel's visit.</p>

<p>When nearly all the guests had arrived, and we were to take
our places, the ladies occupied the whole of the table to the
right of the entrance; there were a good many of them, surrounding
the closely veiled bride. The table at the far end
accommodated the general company, in due precedence.</p>

<p>At the one opposite the ladies, Eucritus had the first place,
with Aristaenetus next him. Then a doubt arose whether the
next was Zenothemis the Stoic's, in virtue of his years, or
Hermon the Epicurean's, who is priest of the Twin Gods<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>,
and also of the noblest blood in the land. Zenothemis found
the solution. 'Aristaenetus,' he said, 'if you place me below
this Epicurean (I need not use worse language than <i>that</i>), I at
once leave the room'; and calling his servant he made as if to
depart. 'Have your way, Zenothemis,' said Hermon, 'though,
whatever your contempt for Epicurus, etiquette would have
suggested your giving way to my priesthood, if I had no other
claims.' 'Priest and Epicurean! that is a good joke,' retorted
Zenothemis, and took the place, with Hermon next him, however.
Then came Cleodemus the Peripatetic, Ion with the
bridegroom, myself, Diphilus and his pupil Zeno, then Dionysodorus
the rhetorician and Histiaeus the literary man.</p>

<p><i>Phi</i>. Upon my word, a very temple of the Muses, peopled
mainly with the learned! I congratulate Aristaenetus on
choosing for his guests on so auspicious an occasion these patterns
of wisdom; he skimmed the cream off every sect in a most
catholic spirit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh, yes, he is not one's idea of the rich man at all; he
cares for culture, and gives most of his time to those who
have it.</p>

<p>Well, we fell to, quietly at first, on the ample and varied fare.
But you do not want a catalogue of soups and pastry and sauces;
there was plenty of everything. At this stage Cleodemus bent
down to Ion, and said: 'Do you see how the old man' (this
was Zenothemis; I could overhear their talk) 'is stuffing down
the good things&mdash;his dress gets a good deal of the gravy&mdash;and
what a lot he hands back to his servant? he thinks we cannot
see him, and does not care whether there will be enough to go
round. Just call Lycinus's attention to him.' This was quite
unnecessary, as I had had an excellent view of it for some
time.</p>

<p>Just after Cleodemus had said this, in burst Alcidamas the
cynic. He had not been asked, but put a good face upon it
with the usual 'No summons Menelaus waits.' The general
opinion clearly was that he was an impudent rogue, and various
people struck in with what came to hand: 'What, Menelaus,
art distraught?' or, 'It liked not Agamemnon, Atreus' son,'
and other neat tags suited to the occasion; but these were all
asides; no one ventured to make them audible to him. Alcidamas
is a man uncommonly 'good at the war-cry'; he will
bark you louder than any dog of them all, literal or metaphorical;
my gentlemen all knew he was their better, and lay low.</p>

<p>Aristaenetus told him he was quite right to come; would he
take a chair and sit behind Histiaeus and Dionysodorus?
'Stuff!' he said; 'a soft womanish trick, to sit on a chair or
a stool! one might as well loll at one's food half on one's back,
like all of you on this soft couch with purple cushions under
you. As for me, I will take my dinner standing and walking
about the room. If I get tired, I will lay my old cloak on the
ground and prop myself on my elbow like Heracles in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
pictures.' 'Just as you please,' said Aristaenetus; and after
that Alcidamas fed walking round, shifting his quarters like the
Scythians according to where pasturage was richest, and following
the servants up as they carried the dishes.</p>

<p>However, he did not let feeding interrupt his energetic expositions
of virtue and vice, and his scoffs at gold and silver.
What was the good of this multitude of wonderful cups, he
wanted to know, when earthenware would serve the purpose?
Aristaenetus got rid of his obtrusiveness for the moment by
signing to his servant to hand the cynic a huge goblet of potent
liquor. It seemed a happy thought; but he little knew the
woes that were to flow from that goblet. When Alcidamas got
it, he was quiet for a while, throwing himself on the ground in
dishabille as he had threatened, with his elbow planted vertically,
just in the attitude of the painters' <i>Heracles with Pholus</i>.</p>

<p>By this time the wine was flowing pretty freely everywhere;
healths were drunk, conversation was general, and the lights
had come in. I now noticed the boy standing near Cleodemus&mdash;a
good-looking cupbearer&mdash;to have an odd smile on. I suppose
I am to give you all the by-play of the dinner, especially
any tender incidents. Well, so I was trying to get at the
reason for the smile. In a little while he came to take Cleodemus's
cup from him; he gave the boy's fingers a pinch, and
handed him up a couple of shillings, I think it was, with the
cup. The smile appeared again in response to the pinch, but
I imagine he failed to notice the coins; he did not get hold of
them; they went ringing on the floor, and there were two
blushing faces to be seen. Those round, however, could not
tell whose the money was, the boy saying he had not dropped
it, and Cleodemus, at whose place it had been heard to fall, not
confessing to the loss. So the matter was soon done with;
hardly any one had grasped the situation&mdash;only Aristaenetus,
as far as I could gather. He shifted the boy soon after, effecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the transfer without any fuss, and assigned Cleodemus a strong
grown-up fellow who might be a mule or horse groom. So
much for that business; it would have seriously compromised
Cleodemus if it had attracted general attention; but it was
smothered forthwith by Aristaenetus's tactful handling of the
offence.</p>

<p>Alcidamas the cynic, who had now emptied his goblet, after
finding out the bride's name, called for silence; he then faced
the ladies, and cried out in a loud voice: 'Cleanthis, I drink to
you in the name of my patron Heracles.' There was a general
laugh; upon which, 'You vile scum,' says he, 'you laugh, do
you, because I invoke our God Heracles as I toast the bride?
Let me tell you that, if she will not pledge me, she shall never
bear a son as brave of spirit, as free of judgement, as strong of
body, as myself.' And he proceeded to show us more of the said
body, till it was scarcely decent. The company irritated him
by laughing again; he stood there with a wandering wrathful
eye, and looked as if he were going to make trouble. He would
probably have brought down his stick on somebody's head,
but for the timely arrival of an enormous cake, the sight of
which mollified him; he quieted down, and accompanied its
progress, eating hard.</p>

<p>The rest were mostly flushed with wine by this time, and the
room was full of clamour. Dionysodorus the rhetorician was
alternately delivering speeches of his own composition and
receiving the plaudits of the servants behind. Histiaeus, the
literary man below him, was making an eclectic mixture of
Pindar, Hesiod, and Anacreon, whose collaboration produced
a most remarkable ode, some of it really prophetic of what was
soon to come&mdash;'Then hide met stubborn hide,' for instance,
and 'Uprose the wailings and the prayers of men.' Zenothemis
too had taken a scroll in small writing from his servant, which
he was reading aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Now came one of the usual slight breaks in the procession of
dishes; and Aristaenetus, to avoid the embarrassment of a
blank, told his jester to come in and talk or perform, by way
of putting the company still more at their ease. So in came
an ugly fellow with a shaven head&mdash;just a few hairs standing
upright on the crown. He danced with dislocations and contortions,
which made him still more absurd, then improvised
and delivered some anapaests in an Egyptian accent, and wound
up with witticisms on the guests.</p>

<p>Most of them took these in good part; but when it came
to Alcidamas's turn, and he called him a Maltese poodle<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
Alcidamas, who had shown signs of jealousy for some time and
did not at all like the way he was holding every one's attention,
lost his temper. He threw off his cloak and challenged the
fellow to a bout of pancratium; otherwise he would let him
feel his stick. So poor Satyrion, as the jester was called, had
to accept the challenge and stand up. A charming spectacle&mdash;the
philosopher sparring and exchanging blows with a buffoon!
Some of us were scandalized and some amused, till Alcidamas
found he had his bellyful, being no match for the tough little
fellow. They gave us a good laugh.</p>

<p>It was now, not long after this match, that Dionicus the doctor
came in. He had been detained, he said, by a brain-fever case;
the patient was Polyprepon the piper, and thereby hung a tale.
He had no sooner entered the room, not knowing how far gone
the man was, when he jumped up, secured the door, drew a
dagger, and handed him the pipes, with an order to play them;
and when Dionicus could not, he took a strap and inflicted
chastisement on the palms of his hands. To escape from this
perilous position, Dionicus proposed a match, with a scale of
forfeits to be exacted with the strap. He played first himself,
and then handed over the pipes, receiving in exchange the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
strap and dagger. These he lost no time in sending out of
window into the open court, after which it was safe to grapple
with him and shout for help; the neighbours broke open the
door and rescued him. He showed us his wealed hands and
some scratches on his face. His story had as distinguished
a success as the jester before; he then squeezed himself in by
Histiaeus and dined on what was left. His coming was providential,
and he most useful in the sequel.</p>

<p>There now appeared a messenger who said he brought a
communication from Hetoemocles the Stoic, which his master
had directed him to read publicly, and then return. With
Aristaenetus's permission he took it to the lamp, and began
reading.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> The usual thing, I suppose&mdash;a panegyric on the bride,
or an epithalamium?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Just what we took it for; however, it was quite another
story. Here are the contents:</p>

<p class="center"><i>HETOEMOCLES THE PHILOSOPHER TO ARISTAENETUS,
GREETING.</i></p>

<p><i>My views on dining are easily deducible from my whole past
life; though daily importuned by far richer men than you to join
them, I invariably refuse; I know too well the tumults and follies
that attend the wine-cup. But if there is one whose neglect
I may fairly resent, it is yourself; the fruit of my long and unremitting
attentions to you is to find myself not on the roll of your
friends; I, your next-door neighbour, am singled out for exclusion.
The sting of it is in the personal ingratitude; happiness for me is
not found in a plate of wild boar or hare or pastry; these I get in
abundance at the houses of people who understand the proprieties;
this very day I might have dined (and well, by all accounts) with
my pupil Pammenes; but he pressed me to no purpose; I was
reserving myself, poor fool, for you.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>But you pass me by, and feast others. I ought not to be surprised;
you have not acquired the power of distinguishing merit;
you have no apprehensive imagination. I know whence the blow
comes; it is from your precious philosophers, Zenothemis and The
Labyrinth, whose mouths (though I would not boast) I could stop
with a single syllogism. Let either of them tell me, What is Philosophy?
or, not to go beyond the merest elements, how does</i> condition
<i>differ from</i> constitution? <i>for I will not resort to real
puzzles, as the</i> Horns[1], <i>the</i> Sorites[1], <i>or the</i> Reaper<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. <i>Well,
I wish you joy of their company. As for me, holding as I do that
nothing is good but what is right, I shall get over a slight like
this.</i></p>

<p><i>You will be kind enough not to resort later to the well-worn
excuse of having forgotten in the bustle of your engagements; I
have spoken to you twice to-day, in the morning at your house,
and later when you were sacrificing at the Anaceum. This is to
let your guests know the rights of the case.</i></p>

<p><i>If you think it is the dinner I care about, reflect upon the story
of Oeneus; you will observe that, when he omitted Artemis alone
from the Gods to whom he offered sacrifice, she resented it. Homer's
account of it states that he</i></p>

<p><i>I quote you but these few of the many passages upon the incident,
just to suggest the qualities of him whom you have passed over, to
entertain, and to have your son taught by, Diphilus! natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>enough; of course, the lad fancies him, and finds him an agreeable
master! If tale-telling were not beneath me, I would add a piece
of information that, if you choose, you can get confirmed by the
boy's attendant Zopyrus. But a wedding is not a time for unpleasantness
or denunciations, especially of offences so vile. Diphilus
deserves it richly at my hands, indeed&mdash;two pupils he has stolen
from me&mdash;; but for the good name of Philosophy I will hold
my hand.</i></p>

<p><i>My man has instructions, if you should offer him a portion of
wild boar or venison or sesame cake to bring me in lieu of my dinner,
to refuse it. I would not have you find the motive of my letter in
such desires.</i></p>

<p>My dear fellow, I went all hot and cold as this was read;
I was praying that the earth might swallow me up when I saw
everybody laughing at the different points; the most amused
were those who knew Hetoemocles and his white hair and
reverend looks; it was such a surprise to find the reality behind
that imposing beard and serious countenance. I felt sure
Aristaenetus had passed him over not in neglect, but because
he supposed he would never accept an invitation or have anything
to do with festivities; he had thought it out of the question,
and not worth trying.</p>

<p>As soon as the man stopped reading, all eyes were turned on
Zeno and Diphilus, who were pale with apprehension, and confirmed
by their embarrassment the insinuations of Hetoemocles.
Aristaenetus was uneasy and disturbed, but urged us to drink,
and tried to smooth the matter over with an attempt at a smile;
he told the man he would see to it, and dismissed him. Zeno
disappeared shortly after; his attendant had signed to him, as
from his father, to retire.</p>

<p>Cleodemus had been on the look-out for an opportunity;
he was spoiling for a fight with the Stoics, and chafing over the
difficulty of starting the subject; but the letter had struck the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
right key, and off he went. 'Now we see the productions of
your fine Chrysippus, your glorious Zeno, your Cleanthes&mdash;a
few poor catch-words, some fruitless posers, a philosophic
exterior, and a large supply of&mdash;Hetoemocleses. What ripe
wisdom does this letter reveal, with its conclusion that Aristaenetus
is an Oeneus, and Hetoemocles an Artemis! How
auspicious, how suitable to the occasion, its tone!'</p>

<p>'To be sure,' chimed in Hermon, his left-hand neighbour;
'he had no doubt heard that Aristaenetus had bespoken a wild
boar, and thought the introduction of the one at Calydon
appropriate. Aristaenetus, I adjure you by the domestic altar,
let him taste the victim, or we shall have the old man starving,
and withering away like his Meleager. Though indeed it would
not be so very hard on him; such a fate is one of Chrysippus's
<i>things indifferent</i>.'</p>

<p>Here Zenothemis woke up and thundered out: 'Chrysippus?
you name that name? because a pretender like Hetoemocles
comes short of his profession, you argue from him to the real
sages, to Cleanthes and Zeno? And who are the men, pray,
who hold such language? Why, Hermon, who shore the curls,
the solid golden curls, of the Dioscuri, and who will yet receive
his barber's fee from the executioner. And Cleodemus, who
was caught in adultery with his pupil Sostratus's wife, and paid
the shameful penalty. Silence would better become the owners
of such consciences.' 'Who trades in his own wife's favours?'
retorted Cleodemus; 'I do not do that, and I do not undertake
to keep my foreign pupil's purse and then swear by Polias the
deposit was never made; I do not lend money at fifty per cent,
and I do not hale my pupils into court if fees are not paid to the
day.' 'You will hardly deny, though,' said Zenothemis, 'that
you supplied Crito with the poison for his father.'</p>

<p>And therewith, his cup being in his hand, about half full of
wine, he emptied it over the pair; and Ion, whose worst guilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
was being their neighbour, came in for a good deal of it. Hermon
bent forward, dried his head, and entered a protest. Cleodemus,
having no wine to reply with, leant over and spat at
Zenothemis; at the same time he clutched the old man's beard
with his left hand, and was aiming a blow which would have
killed him, when Aristaenetus arrested it, stepped over Zenothemis,
and lay down between the two, making himself a buffer
in the interests of peace.</p>

<p>All this time, Philo, my thoughts were busy enough with the
old commonplace, that after all it is no use having all theory
at your finger's ends, if you do not conform your conduct to
the right. Here were these masters of precept making themselves
perfectly ridiculous in practice. Then it was borne in
upon me that possibly the vulgar notion is right, and culture
only misleads the people who are too much wrapt up in
books and bookish ideas. Of all that philosophic company
there was not a man&mdash;not so much as an accidental exception&mdash;who
could pass muster; if his conduct did not condemn
him, his words did yet more fatally. I could not make the
wine responsible, either; the author of that letter was fasting
and sober.</p>

<p>Things seemed to go by contraries; you might see the
ordinary people behaving quite properly at table; no rioting
and disorder there; the most they did was to laugh at and, no
doubt, censure the others, whom they had been accustomed to
respect and to credit with the qualities their appearance suggested.
It was the wise men who made beasts of themselves,
abused each other, over-fed, shouted and came to blows.
I thought one could find no better illustration for our dinner
than the poets' story of Eris. When she was not invited to
Peleus's nuptials, she threw that apple on the table which
brought about the great Trojan war. Hetoemocles's letter was
just such an apple, woeful Iliad and all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>For buffer-Aristaenetus had proved ineffectual, and the
quarrel between Zenothemis and Cleodemus was proceeding.
'For the present,' said the latter, 'I am satisfied with exposing
your ignorance; to-morrow I will give you your deserts more
adequately. Pray explain, Zenothemis, or the reputable Diphilus
for you, how it is that you Stoics class the acquisition of wealth
among the things indifferent, and then concentrate your whole
efforts upon it, hang perpetually about the rich to that end,
lend money, screw out your usury, and take pay for your teaching.
Or again, if you hate pleasure and condemn the Epicureans,
how comes it that you will do and endure the meanest
things for it? you resent it if you are not asked out; and when
you are, you eat so much, and convey so much more to your
servant's keeping'&mdash;and he interrupted himself to make a grab
at the napkin that Zenothemis's boy was holding, full of all
sorts of provender; he meant to get it away and empty the
contents on the floor; but the boy held on too tight.</p>

<p>'Quite right, Cleodemus,' said Hermon; 'let them tell us
why they condemn pleasure, and yet expect more of it than
any one else.' 'No, no,' says Zenothemis; 'you give us your
grounds, Cleodemus, for saying wealth is <i>not</i> a thing indifferent.'
'No, I tell you; let us have <i>your</i> case.' So the see-saw went
on, till Ion came out of his retirement and called a truce: 'I
will give you,' he said, 'a theme worthy of the occasion; and
you shall speak and listen without trying for personal triumphs;
take a leaf from our Plato this time.' 'Hear, hear,' from the
company, especially from Aristaenetus and Eucritus, who hailed
this escape from unpleasantness. The former now went back
to his own place, confident of peace.</p>

<p>The 'repast,' as they call it, had just made its appearance;
each guest was served with a bird, a slice of wild boar, a portion
of hare, a fried fish, some sesame cakes and sweet-meats&mdash;all these
to be taken home if the guest chose. Every man had not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
separate dish, however; Aristaenetus and Eucritus shared one
little table, from which each was to take what belonged to him;
so Zenothemis the Stoic and Hermon the Epicurean; Cleodemus
and Ion had the third table, the bridegroom and I the next;
Diphilus had a double portion, by the absence of Zeno. Remember
these details, Philo; you will find they bear on the story.</p>

<p><i>Phi.</i> Trust me.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Ion proceeded: 'I will start, then, if you wish it.' He
reflected a moment, and then: 'With so much talent in the
room, no less a subject might seem indicated than Ideas<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, Incorporeals,
and the Immortality of the Soul. On the other
hand our divergent views might make that too controversial;
so I will take the question of marriage, and say what seems
appropriate. The counsel of perfection here would be to dispense
with it, and be satisfied, according to the prescription
of Plato and Socrates, with contemplating male beauty. So, and
only so, is absolute virtue to be attained. But if marriage is admitted
as a practical necessity, then we should adopt the Platonic
system of holding our wives in common, thus obviating rivality.'</p>

<p>The unseasonableness of these remarks raised a laugh. And
Dionysodorus had another criticism: 'Spare us these provincialisms,'
he said; 'or give us your authority for "rivality."'
'Such carpings are beneath contempt,' was the polite reply.
Dionysodorus was about to return the compliment with interest,
when our good man of letters intervened: 'Stop,' said Histiaeus,
'and let me read you an epithalamium.'</p>

<p>He at once went off at score; and I think I can reproduce
the effusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or like, in Aristaenetus's hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cleanthis, softly nurtured bright princess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surpassing other beauties virginal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cythera's Queen, or Helen's loveliness.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bridegroom, the best of your contemporaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nireus's and Achilles' peer, rejoice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we in hymeneal voluntaries<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the pair keep lifting up our voice.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the time the laughter that not unnaturally followed had
subsided, it was time to pack up our 'repasts'; Aristaenetus
and Eucritus took each his intended portion; Chaereas and I,
Ion and Cleodemus, did likewise. But as Zeno was not there,
Diphilus expected to come in for his share too. He said everything
on that table was his, and disputed possession with the
servants. There was a tug of war between them just like that
over the body of Patroclus; at last he was worsted and had to
let go, to the huge amusement of all, which he heightened by
taking the thing as a most serious wrong.</p>

<p>As I told you, Hermon and Zenothemis were neighbours, the
latter having the upper place. Their portions were equal
enough except in one respect, and the division was peaceful
until that was reached. But the bird on Hermon's side was&mdash;by
chance, no doubt&mdash;the fatter. The moment came for them
to take their respective birds. At this point&mdash;now attend carefully,
please, Philo; here is the kernel of the whole affair&mdash;at
this point Zenothemis let his own bird lie, and took the fatter
one before Hermon. But Hermon was not going to be put
upon; he laid hold of it too. Then their voices were lifted
up, they closed, belaboured each other's faces with the birds,
clutched each other's beards, and called for assistance, Hermon
appealing to Cleodemus, Zenothemis to Alcidamas and Diphilus.
The allies took their sides, Ion alone preserving neutrality.</p>

<p>The hosts engaged. Zenothemis lifted a goblet from the
table where it stood before Aristaenetus, and hurled it at
Hermon;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And him it missed, but found another mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">laying open the bridegroom's skull with a sound deep gash.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>This opened the lips of the ladies; most of them indeed jumped
down into the battle's interspace, led by the young man's
mother, as soon as she saw his blood flowing; the bride too
was startled from her place by terror for him. Meanwhile
Alcidamas was in his glory maintaining the cause of Zenothemis;
down came his stick on Cleodemus's skull, he injured Hermon's
jaw, and severely wounded several of the servants who tried to
protect them. The other side were not beaten, however;
Cleodemus with levelled finger was gouging out Zenothemis's
eye, not to mention fastening on his nose and biting a piece off
it; and when Diphilus came to Zenothemis's rescue, Hermon
pitched him head first from the couch.</p>

<p>Histiaeus too was wounded in trying to part the pair; it was
a kick in the teeth, I think, from Cleodemus, who took him for
Diphilus. So the poor man of letters lay 'disgorging blood,'
as his own Homer describes it. It was a scene of tumult and
tears. The women were hanging over Chaereas and wailing,
the other men trying to restore peace. The great centre of
destruction was Alcidamas, who after routing the forces immediately
opposed to him was striking at whatever presented
itself. Many a man had fallen there, be sure, had he not
broken his stick. I was standing close up to the wall watching
the proceedings in which I took no part; Histiaeus's fate had
taught me the dangers of intervention. It was a sight to recall
the Lapithae and Centaurs&mdash;tables upside down, blood in
streams, bowls hurtling in the air.</p>

<p>At last Alcidamas upset the lamp, there was a great darkness,
and confusion was worse confounded. It was not so easy to
procure another light, and many a horrid deed was done in the
dark. When some one came at last with a lamp, Alcidamas
was discovered stripping and applying compulsion to the flute-girl,
and Dionysodorus proved to have been as incongruously
engaged; as he stood up, a goblet rolled out of his bosom. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
account of the matter was that Ion had picked it up in the
confusion, and given it him to save it from damage! for which
piece of carefulness Ion was willing to receive credit.</p>

<p>So the party came to an end, tears being resolved in the
laughter at Alcidamas, Dionysodorus and Ion. The wounded
were borne off in sad case, especially old Zenothemis, holding
one hand on his nose and the other on his eye, and bellowing
out that the agony was more than he could bear. Hermon
was in poor condition himself, having lost a couple of teeth;
but he could not let this piece of evidence go; 'Bear in mind,
Zenothemis,' he called out, 'that you do <i>not</i> consider pain
a thing indifferent.' The bridegroom, who had been seen to
by Dionicus, was also taken off with his head in bandages&mdash;in
the carriage in which he was to have taken his bride home. It
had been a sorry wedding-feast for him, poor fellow. Dionicus
had done what he could for the rest, they were taken home to
bed, and very ill most of them were on the way. Alcidamas
stayed where he was; it was impossible to get rid of him, as
he had thrown himself down anyhow across a couch and fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>And now you know all about the banquet, my dear Philo;
a tragedy epilogue seems called for:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hidden power sways each hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men propose, the Gods dispose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail surmises, come surprises.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the unexpected that came to pass here, at any rate.
Well, live and learn; I know now that a quiet man had better
keep clear of these feasts of reason.</p>

<h2>DEMOSTHENES<br />

AN ENCOMIUM</h2>


<p>A little before noon on the sixteenth, I was walking in the
Porch&mdash;it was on the left-hand side as you go out&mdash;, when
Thersagoras appeared; I dare say he is known to some of you&mdash;short,
hook-nosed, fair-complexioned, and virile. He drew
nearer, and I spoke: 'Thersagoras the poet. Whence, and
whither?' 'From home, hither,' he replied. 'Just a stroll?'
I asked. 'Why, I do need a stroll too,' he said. 'I got up in
the small hours, impressed with the duty of making a poetic
offering on Homer's birthday.' 'Very proper,' said I; 'a good
way of paying for the education he has given you.' 'That was
how I began,' he continued, 'and time has glided by till now
it is just upon noon; that was what I meant by saying I wanted
a stroll.</p>

<p>'However, I wanted something else much more&mdash;an interview
with this gentleman' (and he pointed to the Homer;
you know the one on the right of the Ptolemies' shrine, with
the hair hanging loose); 'I came to greet him, and to pray for
a good flow of verse.' 'Ah,' I sighed, 'if prayers would do it!
in that case <i>I</i> should have given Demosthenes a worrying for
assistance against <i>his</i> birthday. If prayers availed, I would join
my wishes to yours; for the boons we desire are the same.'
'Well, I put down to Homer,' he replied, 'my facility of this
night and morning; ardours divine and mystic have possessed
me. But you shall judge. Here are my tablets, which I have
brought with designs upon any idle friend I might light upon;
and you, I rejoice to see, are idle.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you lucky man!' I exclaimed; 'you are like the winner
of the three miles, who had washed off the dust, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
amuse himself for the rest of the day. He was minded to crack
a story with the wrestler, when the wrestling was next on the
programme; but the wrestler asked him whether he had felt
like cracking stories when he toed the line just now. You
have won your poetic three miles, and want me to minister to
your amusement just as I am shivering at the thought of my
hundred yards.' He laughed: 'Why, how will it make things
worse for you?'</p>

<p>'Ah, you probably consider Demosthenes of much less
account than Homer. <i>You</i> are very proud of your eulogy on
Homer; and is Demosthenes a light matter to <i>me</i>?' 'A
trumped up charge,' he exclaimed; 'I am not going to sow
dissension between these two mighty ones, though it is true my
own allegiance is rather to Homer.'</p>

<p>'Good,' I said, 'and you must allow me to give mine to
Demosthenes. But, though you do not disqualify my subject,
I am sure you think poetry the only real treatment; you feel
about mere rhetoric what the cavalryman feels as he gallops
past the infantry.' 'I hope I am not so mad as that,' he said,
'though a considerable touch of madness is required of him
who would pass the gates of poetry.' 'If you come to that,
prose cannot do without some divine inspiration either, if it is
not to be flat and common.' He admitted that at once: 'I
often delight myself with comparing passages from Demosthenes
and other prose writers with Homer in point of vehemence,
pungency, fire. "Flown with wine" I pair off against the
revellings and dancings and debauchery of Philip; "One presage
that ne'er fails<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>" finds its counterpart in "It is for brave
men, founding themselves upon brave hopes&mdash;"; "How would
old Peleus, lord of steeds, repine&mdash;" is matched by "What
a cry of lamentation would go up from the men of those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
who laid down their lives for glory and freedom&mdash;"; "fluent
Python" reminds me of Odysseus's "snow-flake speech"; "If
'twere our lot neither to age nor die," I illustrate by "For every
man's life must end in death, though he shut himself up in a
narrow chamber for safer keeping." In fact the instances are
numberless in which they attack their meaning by the same
road.</p>

<p>'I love too to study his feelings and moods and transitions, the
variety with which he combats weariness, his resumptions after
digression, the charm of his opportune illustrations, and the
never-failing native purity of his style.</p>

<p>'It has often struck me about Demosthenes&mdash;for I will tell
the whole truth out&mdash;that that looser of the bonds of speech
rebukes Athenian slackness with a dignity that is lacking in
the "Greekesses" used by Homer of the Greeks; and again
he maintains the tragic intensity proper to the great Hellenic
drama more consistently than the poet who inserts speeches at the
very crisis of battle and allows energy to evaporate in words.</p>

<p>'As often as I read Demosthenes, the balanced clauses, the
rhythmic movement and cadence, make me forget that this is
not my beloved poetry; for Homer too abounds in contrast
and parallel, in figures startling or simple. It is a provision of
nature, I suppose, that each faculty should have its proper
equipment attached to it. How should I scorn your Muse?
I know her powers too well.</p>

<p>'None the less, I consider my task of a Homeric encomium
twice as difficult as your praise of Demosthenes; not because
it must be in verse, but from the nature of the material; <i>I</i>
cannot lay down a foundation of fact to build the edifice of
praise upon; there is nothing but the poems themselves. Everything
else is uncertain&mdash;his country, his family, his time. If
there had been any uncertainty about them,</p>

<p class="center">Debate and strife had not divided men;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>but as it is, they give him for a country Ios or Colophon or
Cumae, Chios, Smyrna, or Egyptian Thebes, or half a hundred
other places; his father may be Maeon the Lydian, or he may
be a river; his mother is now Melanope, and now in default of
satisfactory human descent a dryad; his time is the Heroic
Age, or else perhaps it is the Ionic. There is no knowing for
certain whether he was before or after Hesiod, even; and no
wonder, considering that some object to his very name, and
will have him Melesigenes instead. So too with his poverty,
and his blindness. However, all these questions are best left
alone. So you see the arena open to my panegyric is extremely
limited; my theme is a poet and not a man of action; I can
infer and collect his wisdom only from his verses.</p>

<p>'<i>Your</i> work, now, can be reeled smoothly off out of hand;
you have your definite known facts; the butcher's meat is
there, only needing to be garnished with the sauce of your
words. History supplies you with the greatness and distinction
of Demosthenes; it is all known; his country was Athens, the
splendid, the famous, the bulwark of Hellas. Now if <i>I</i> could
have laid hands on Athens, I might have used the poet's right
to introduce the loves and judgements and sojourns there of
the Gods, the gifts they lavished on it, the tale of Eleusis. As
for its laws and courts and festivals, its Piraeus and its colonies,
the memorials set up in it of victory by land and sea, Demosthenes
himself is the authority for saying that no words could
do justice to them. My material would have been inexhaustible;
and I could not have been accused of hanging up my
true theme; the formula of panegyric includes the arraying of
the man in the splendours of his country. So too Isocrates
ekes out his <i>Helen</i> by introducing Theseus. It is true that
poets have their privileges; and perhaps <i>you</i> have to be more
careful about your proportions; there must not be <i>too</i> much
sack to the proverbial halfpennyworth of bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well then, let Athens go; but your discourse at once finds
another support in his father's wealth&mdash;that "golden base"
which Pindar likes&mdash;; for to be responsible for providing a war-ship
was to be among the richest Athenians in those days. And
though he died while Demosthenes was quite a child, we are
not to count his orphan state a disaster; it led to the distinction
that brought his splendid gifts into notice.</p>

<p>'Tradition gives us no hint of how Homer was educated or
developed his powers; the panegyrist must plunge straight into
his works, and can find nothing to talk about in his breeding and
training and pupilage; he has not even the resource of that
Hesiodic sprig of bay which could make a facile poet out of
a shepherd. But think of <i>your</i> abundance in this branch
of the subject. There is Callistratus and all the mighty roll of
orators, Alcidamas, Isocrates, Isaeus, Eubulides. Then again,
at Athens even those who were subject to paternal control had
countless temptations to indulgence, youth is the susceptible
time, a neglected ward could have lived as irregular a life as he
chose, and yet the objects that Demosthenes set up for himself
were philosophy and patriotism, and the doors they took him
to not Phryne's, but those of Aristotle and Theophrastus,
Xenocrates and Plato.</p>

<p>'And so, my dear sir, your way is open to a disquisition upon
the two kinds of human love, the one sprung of a desire that is
like the sea, outrageous, fierce, stormily rocking the soul; it is
a true sea wave, which the earthly Aphrodite sets rolling with
the tempestuous passions of youth; but the other is the steady
drawing of a golden cord from heaven; it does not scorch and
pierce and leave festering wounds; it impels towards the pure
and unsullied ideal of absolute beauty, and is a sane madness
in those souls which "yet hold of Zeus and nurse the spark
divine."</p>

<p>'Love will find out the way, though that way involve a shaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
head, a cavern dwelling, a discouraging mirror and punitive
sword, a disciplining of the tongue, a belated apprenticeship to
the actor's art, a straining of the memory, a conquest over
clamour, and a borrowing of night hours to lengthen toilsome
days.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> All this your Demosthenes endured, and who knows
not what an orator it made of him? his speech packed with
thought and terse of language, himself convincing in his knowledge
of human nature, as splendid in the elevation as mighty
in the force of his sentiments, the master and not the slave of
his words and his ideas, ever fresh with the graces of his art. He
is the one orator whose speech has, in the bold phrase of Leosthenes,
at once the breath of life and the strength of wrought
iron.</p>

<p>'Callisthenes remarked of Aeschylus that he wrote his tragedies
in wine, which lent vigour and warmth to his work. With
Demosthenes it was otherwise; he composed not on wine but
on water; whence the witticism of Demades, that most men's
tongues are regulated by water,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but Demosthenes's pen was
subject to the same influence. And Pytheas detected the smell
of the midnight oil in the very perfection of the speeches.
Well, there is much in common between your subject and mine,
so far as this branch of them is concerned; on Homer's <i>poems</i>
I was no worse off than you are.</p>

<p>'But when you come to your hero's acts of humanity, his
pecuniary sacrifices, his grand political achievements' (and he
was going on in full swing to the rest of the catalogue, when
I interrupted, with a laugh: 'Must I be dowsed with the
remainder of your canful, good bath-man?' 'Most certainly,'
he retorted, and went straight on), 'the public entertainments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>he gave, the public burdens he assumed, the ships, the wall,
the trench he contributed to, the prisoners he ransomed, the
girls he portioned, his admirable policy, the embassies he served
on, the laws he got passed, the mighty issues he was concerned
in&mdash;why, then I cannot but laugh to see your contracted
brows; as if a recital of the exploits of Demosthenes <i>could</i> lack
matter!'</p>

<p>'I believe you think, my good man,' I protested, 'that I have
never had the deeds of Demosthenes drummed into me; I
should be singular among rhetoricians, then.' 'It was on the
assumption,' he said, 'implied by you, that we want assistance.
But perhaps your case is a very different one; is the light so
bright that you cannot manage to fix your eyes on the dazzling
glory of Demosthenes? Well, I was rather like that about
Homer at first. Indeed, I came very near turning mine away,
thinking I could not possibly face my subject. However, I got
over it somehow or other; became gradually inured, as it
were, superior to the weakness of vision that would have condemned
me for a bastard eagle and no true son of Homer.</p>

<p>'But now here is another great advantage that I consider you
have over me. The poetic faculty has a single aim; from which
it follows that Homer's glory must be laid hold of at once and
as a whole. You on the other hand, if you were to attempt
dealing with the whole Demosthenes all at once, would never
know what to say; you would waver and not be able to set your
thoughts to work. You would be like the <i>gourmand</i> at a Sicilian
banquet, or the aesthete who has a thousand delightful sights and
sounds presented to him at once; they do not know which way
to turn for their conflicting desires. I suspect that you too are
distracted and find concentration impossible; all round you are
the varied attractions&mdash;his magnanimity, his fire, his orderly
life, his oratorical force and practical courage, the endless opportunities
of gain that he scorned, his justice, humanity, honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
spirit, sagacity, and each of all his great services to his country.
It may well be that, when you behold on this side decrees,
ambassadors, speeches, laws, on the other, fleets, Euboea, Boeotia,
Chios, Rhodes, the Hellespont, Byzantium, you are pulled to
and fro among these too numerous invitations, and cannot tell
which to accept.</p>

<p>'Pindar once found himself in a similar difficulty with an over-abundant
theme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ismenus? Melia's distaff golden-bright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cadmus? the race from dragon's teeth that came?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thebe's dark circlet? the all-daring might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heracles? great Bacchus' merry fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White-armed Harmonia's bridal?&mdash;Ay, but which?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Muse, we're poor in that we are too rich.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You, I dare say, are in the same quandary. Logic and life,
rhetoric and philosophy, popularity and death&mdash;ay, but which?</p>

<p>'The maze is quite easy to escape from, though; you have
only to take hold of one single clue, no matter which&mdash;his
oratory, if you will, so that it is taken by itself&mdash;, and stick to
that one throughout your present discourse. You will have
ample material; his oratory is not of the Periclean type. Pericles
could lighten and thunder, and he could hit the right nail
on the head; so much tradition tells us; but we have nothing
to judge for ourselves by, no doubt because, beyond the momentary
impression produced, there was in his performances no
element of permanence, nothing that could stand the searching
test of time. But with Demosthenes's work&mdash;well, that it
will be your province to deal with, if your choice goes that
way.</p>

<p>'Or if you prefer his character, or his policy, it will be well
to isolate some particular detail&mdash;if you are greedy you may pick
out two or three&mdash;which will give you quite enough to go upon;
so great was he at every point. And for such specializing we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have Homer's example; the compliments he pays his heroes
are attached to parts of them, their feet, their heads, their hair,
even their shields or something they have on; and the Gods
seem to have had no objection to poets' basing their praises
merely on a distaff, a bow, or the aegis; a limb or a quality
must pass still more easily; and as for good actions, it is impossible
to give an exhaustive list of them. Demosthenes
accordingly will not blame you for confining your eulogy to
<i>one</i> of his merits, especially as to celebrate the whole of them
worthily would be beyond even <i>his</i> powers.'</p>

<p>When Thersagoras had finished this harangue, I remarked:
'Your intention is plain; I am to be convinced that you are
more than a good poet; so you have constructed your prose
Demosthenes as a pendant to your verse Homer.' 'No, no,'
he said; 'what made me run on so long was the idea that, if
I could ease your mind by showing how light your task was,
I should have secured my listener.' 'Then let me tell you that
<i>your</i> object has not been furthered, and <i>my</i> case has only been
aggravated.' 'A fine doctor I seem to be!' he said. 'Not
knowing where the difficulty lies,' I continued, 'you are a
doctor who mistakes his patient's ailment and treats him for
another.' 'How so?'</p>

<p>'You have been prescribing for the troubles that would
attend a first attempt; unfortunately it is years and years since
I got through that stage, and your remedies are quite out of
date.' 'Why, then,' he exclaimed, 'the cure is complete;
nobody is nervous about a road of which he knows every inch.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but then I have set my heart upon reversing the feat
that Anniceris of Cyrene exhibited to Plato and his friends.
To show what a fine driver he was, he drove round the Academy
time after time exactly in his own track, which looked after it
as if it had only been traversed once. Now my endeavour is
just the opposite, to <i>avoid</i> my old tracks; and it is by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
so easy to keep out of the ruts.' 'Pauson's is the trick for you,'
he said. 'What is that? I never heard of it.'</p>

<p>'Pauson the painter was commissioned to do a horse rolling.
He painted one galloping in a cloud of dust. As he was at work
upon it, his patron came in, and complained that this was not
what he had ordered. Pauson just turned the picture upside
down and told his man to hold it so for inspection; there was
the horse rolling on its back.' 'You dear innocent!' I said;
'do you suppose I have kept my picture turned the same way
all these years? It has been shifted and tilted at every conceivable
angle, till I begin to have apprehensions of ending like
Proteus.' 'And how was that?' 'Oh, I mean the issue of
his attempts to evade human observation; when he had exhausted
all shapes of animals and plants and elements, finding
no metamorphosis left him, he had to be Proteus again.'</p>

<p>'You have more shifts than ever Proteus had,' he said, 'to
get off hearing my poem.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do not say that,' said I; 'off goes my burden of care,
and I am at your service. Perhaps when you have got over
your own pains of child-birth you will show more feeling for
my delicate state.'</p>

<p>He liked the offer, we settled down on a convenient stone
step, and I listened to some excellent poetry. In the middle of
reading he was seized with an idea, did up his tablets, and said:
'You shall have your hearer's fee, as well deserved as an Athenian's
after a day in court or assembly. Thank me, please.' 'I do,
before I know what for. But what may it be?' 'It was in
the Macedonian royal archives that I came across the book;
I was delighted with it at the time, and took considerable
trouble to secure it; it has just come into my head that I have
it at home. It contains, among details of Antipater's management
of the household, facts about Demosthenes that I think
you will find worth your best attention.' 'You shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
payment on the spot,' I said, 'in the shape of an audience for
the rest of your verses; and moreover I shall not part with you
till your promise is fulfilled. You have given me a luscious
Homer birthday dinner; and it seems you are to be at the
charges of the Demosthenes one too.'</p>

<p>He read to the end, we stayed long enough for me to give
the poem its meed of praise, and then adjourned to his house,
where after some search the book was found. I took it away
with me, and on further acquaintance was so much impressed
by it that I shall do no editing, but read it you <i>totidem verbis</i>.
Asclepius is not less honoured if his worshippers, in default of
original compositions, have the hymns of Isodemus or Sophocles
performed before him; there is a failure nowadays in the supply
of new plays for Dionysus; but those who produce the works
of old masters at the proper season have the credit all the same
of honouring the God.</p>

<p>This book, then (the part of the state records that concerns
us is the conversation I shall give you)&mdash;the book informs
us that Archias's name was announced to Antipater. In case
any of my younger hearers should not know the fact already,
this Archias had been charged with the arrest of all exiles. In
particular, he was to get Demosthenes from Calauria into
Antipater's presence, but rather by persuasion than by force.
Antipater was excited about it, hoping that Demosthenes might
arrive any day. So, hearing that Archias was come from Calauria,
he gave orders for his instant admittance.</p>

<p>When he entered&mdash;but you shall have the conversation as it
stands.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Archias. Antipater</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Is it well with you, Antipater?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> It is well, if you have brought Demosthenes.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> I have brought him as I might. I have the urn that
holds his remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Ha? my hopes are dashed. What avail ashes and urns,
if I have not Demosthenes?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> The soul, O King, may not be prisoned in a man's own
despite.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Why took you him not alive?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> We took him.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> And he has died on the way?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> He died where he was, in Calauria.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Your neglect is to blame; you took not due care of him.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Nay, it lies not at our door.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> What mean you? These are riddles, Archias; you took
him alive, and you have him not?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Was it not your charge that we should use no force at
first? Yet indeed we should have fared no better if we had;
we did intend it.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> You did not well, even in the intention; it may be your
violence killed him.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> No, we killed him not; but if we could not persuade
him, there was nothing for it but force. But, O King, how
had you been the better off, if he had come alive? you could
have done no more than kill him.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Peace, Archias! methinks you comprehend neither the
nature of Demosthenes, nor my mind. You think there is no
more in the finding of Demosthenes than in the hunting down
such scoundrels as Himeraeus or Aristonicus or Eucrates; these
are like swollen torrents&mdash;mean fellows in themselves, to whom
a passing storm gives brief importance; they make a brave show
while the disturbance lasts; but they are as sure to vanish soon
as the wind to fall at evening. The recreant Hyperides is
another&mdash;a selfish demagogue, who took no shame to curry
favour with the mob by libelling Demosthenes, and make himself
its instrument for ends that his dupes soon wished they
had never attained; for the libels had not long borne their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
fruit before the libelled was reinstated with more honour than
Alcibiades himself. But what recked Hyperides? he scrupled
not to use against what had once been dearest to him the tongue
that he deserved, even by that iniquity, to lose.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> How? was Demosthenes not our enemy of enemies?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Not in the eyes of one who cares for an honourable
nature, and loves a sincere consistent character. The noble is
noble, though it be in an enemy; and virtue has no country.
Am I meaner than Xerxes? he could admire Bulis and Sperchis
the Spartans, and release them when they were in his power.
No man that ever lived do I admire more than Demosthenes;
twice I was in his company at Athens (in hurried times, it is
true), and I have heard much from others, and there is his work
to judge by. And what moves me is not his skill in speech.
You might well suppose so; Python was nothing, matched with
him, and the Attic orators but babes in comparison with his
finish and intensity, the music of his words, the clearness of his
thoughts, his chains of proof, his cumulative blows. We found
our mistake when we listened to Python and his promises; we
had gathered the Greeks to Athens to see the Athenians confuted;
it was Demosthenes who confuted <i>us.</i> But no words of mine
can describe the power of his eloquence.</p>

<p>Yet to that I give but a secondary place, as a tool the man
used. It was the man himself I marvelled at, his spirit and his
wisdom, and the steadiness of soul that steered a straight course
through all the tempests of fortune with never a craven impulse.
And Philip was of my mind about him; when a speech of his
before the Athenian assembly against Philip was reported,
Parmenio was angry, and made some bitter jest upon him.
But Philip said: <i>Ah, Parmenio, he has a right to say what he
pleases; he is the only popular orator in all Greece whose name
is missing in my secret service accounts, though I would far rather
have put myself in his hands than in those of clerks and third-rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
actors. All the tribe of them are down for gold, timber, rents,
cattle, land, in Boeotia if not in Macedonia<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; but the walls of
Byzantium are not more proof against the battering-ram than
Demosthenes against gold</i>.</p>

<p><i>This is the way I look at it, Parmenio. An Athenian who
speaking in Athens prefers me to his country shall have of my
money, but not of my friendship; as for one who hates me for his
country's sake, I will assault him as I would a citadel, a wall,
a dock, a trench, but I have only admiration for his virtue, and
congratulations for the State that possesses him. The other kind
I should like to crush as soon as they have served my purpose; but
him I would sooner have here with us than the Illyrian and Triballian
horse and all my mercenaries; arguments that carry conviction,
weight of intellect, I do not put below force of arms.</i></p>

<p>That was to Parmenio; and he said much the same to me.
At the time of the Athenian expedition under Diopithes, I was
very anxious, but Philip laughed at me heartily, and said: <i>Are
you afraid of these town-bred generals and their men? Their
fleet, their Piraeus, their docks, I snap my fingers at them. What
is to be looked for from people whose worship is of Dionysus, whose
life is in feasting and dancing? If Demosthenes, and not a man
besides, had been subtracted from Athens, we should have had it
with less trouble than Thebes or Thessaly; deceit and force, energy
and corruption, would soon have done the thing. But he is ever
awake; he misses no occasion; he makes move for move and
counters every stroke. Not a trick of ours, not an attempt begun
or only thought of, but he has intelligence of it; in a word he is
the obstacle that stands between us and the swift attainment of
our ends. It was little fault of his that we took Amphipolis, that
we won Olynthus, Phocis, Thermopylae, that we are masters of
the Hellespont.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p><i>He rouses his reluctant countrymen out of their opiate sleep,
applies to their indolence the knife and cautery of frank statement,
and little he cares whether they like it or not. He transfers
the revenues from state theatre to state armament, re-creates with
his navy bill a fleet disorganized to the verge of extinction, restores
patriotism to the place from which it had long been ousted by the
passion for legal fees, uplifts the eyes of a degenerate race to the
deeds of their fathers and emulation of Marathon and Salamis,
and fits them for Hellenic leagues and combinations. You cannot
escape his vigilance, he is not to be wheedled, you can no more buy
him than the Persian King could buy the great Aristides.</i></p>

<p><i>This is the direction your fears should take, Antipater; never
mind all the war-ships and all the fleets. What Themistocles and
Pericles were to the Athens of old, that is Demosthenes to Athens
to-day, as shrewd as Themistocles, as high of soul as Pericles.
He it was that gained them the control of Euboea and Megara,
the Hellespont and Boeotia. It is well indeed that they give the
command to such as Chares or Diopithes or Proxenus, and keep
Demosthenes to the platform at home. If they had given into his
hands their arms and ships and troops, their strategy and their
money, I doubt he would have put me on my mettle to keep Macedonia;
even now that he has no weapon but his decrees, he is with
us at every turn, his hand is upon us; the ways and means are of
his finding, the force of his gathering; it is he that sends armadas
afar, he that joins power to power, he that meets our every change
of plan.</i></p>

<p>This was his tone about Demosthenes on many other occasions
too; he put it down as one of his debts to fortune that armies
were never led by the man whose mere words were so many
battering-rams and catapults worked from Athens to the shattering
and confounding of his plans. As to Chaeronea, even the
victory made no difference; he continued to impress upon us
how precarious a position this one man had contrived for us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<i>Things went unexpectedly well; their generals were cowards and
their troops undisciplined, and the caprice of fortune, which has
so often served us well, brought us out victorious; but he had reduced
me to hazarding my kingdom and my life on that single
throw; he had brought the most powerful cities into line, he had
united Greece, he had forced Athens and Thebes and all Boeotia,
Corinth, Euboea, Megara&mdash;the might of Greece, in short&mdash;to play
the game out to its end, and had arrested me before I reached
Attic soil.</i></p>

<p>He never ceased to speak thus about Demosthenes. If any
one told him the Athenian democracy was a formidable rival,
'Demosthenes,' he would say, 'is my only rival; Athens without
him is no better than Aenianes or Thessalians.' Whenever
Philip sent embassies to the various states, if Athens had sent
any one else to argue against his men, he always gained his point
with ease; but when it was Demosthenes, he would tell us the
embassy had come to naught: there was not much setting up
of trophies over speeches of Demosthenes.</p>

<p>Such was Philip's opinion. Now I am no Philip at the best,
and do you suppose, Archias, that if I could have got a man
like Demosthenes, I should have found nothing better to do
with him than sending him like an ox to the slaughter? or
should I have made him my right-hand man in the management
of Greece and of the empire? I was instinctively attracted
long ago by his public record&mdash;an attraction heightened by the
witness of Aristotle. He constantly assured both Alexander
and myself that among all the vast number of his pupils he had
found none comparable to Demosthenes in natural genius and
persevering self-development, none whose intellect was at once
so weighty and so agile, none who spoke his opinions so freely
or maintained them so courageously.</p>

<p><i>But you</i> (said Aristotle) <i>confuse him with an Eubulus, a Phrynon</i>,
<i>a Philocrates, and think to convert with gifts a man who has actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
lavished his inheritance half on needy Athenians and half on
Athens; you vainly imagine that you can intimidate one who has
long ago resolved to set his life upon his country's doubtful fortunes;
if he arraigns your proceedings, you try denunciation; why, the
nearer terrors of the Assembly find him unmoved. You do not
realize that the mainspring of his policy is patriotism, and that
the only personal advantage he expects from it is the improvement
of his own nature.</i></p>

<p>All this it was, Archias, that made me long to have him with
me, to hear from his own lips what he thought about the state
of things, and be able at any time of need, abandoning the flatterers
who infest us, to hear the plain words of an independent
mind and profit by sincere advice. And I might fairly have
drawn <i>his</i> attention to the ungrateful nature of those Athenians
for whom he had risked all when he might have had firmer and
less unconscionable friends.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> O King, your other ends you might have gained, but that
you would have told him to no purpose; his love of Athens was
a madness beyond cure.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> It was so indeed; 'twere vain to deny it. But how
died he?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> O King, there is further wonder in store for you. We
who have had the scene before our eyes are as startled and as
unbelieving yet as when we saw it. He must long ago have
determined how to die; his preparation shows it. He was
seated within the temple, and our arguments of the days before
had been spent on him in vain.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Ay? and what were they?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Long and kindly I urged him, with promises on your part,
not that I looked to see them kept (for I knew not then, and took
you to be wroth with him), but in hopes they might prevail.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> And what hearing did he give them? Keep nothing
back; I would I were there now, hearing him with my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
ears; failing which, do you hide nothing from me. 'Tis worth
much to learn the bearing of a true man in the last moments
of his life, whether he gave way and played the coward, or kept
his course unfaltering even to the end.</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Ah, in him was no bending to the storm; how far from
it! With a smiling allusion to my former life, he told me I was
not actor enough to make your lies convincing.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Ha? he left life for want of belief in my promises?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> Not so; hear to the end, and you will see his distrust
was not all for you. Since you bid me speak, O King, he told
me there was no oath that could bind a Macedonian; it was
nothing strange that they should use against Demosthenes the
weapon that had won them Amphipolis, and Olynthus, and
Oropus. And much more of the like; I had writers there,
that his words might be preserved for you. <i>Archias</i> (he said),
<i>the prospect of death or torture would be enough to keep me out of
Antipater's presence. And if you tell me true, I must be on my
guard against the worse danger of receiving life itself as a present
at his hands, and deserting, to serve Macedonia, that post which
I have sworn to hold for Greece.</i></p>

<p><i>Life were a thing to be desired, Archias, were it purchased for
me by the power of Piraeus (a war-ship, my gift, has floated there),
by the wall and trench of which I bore the cost, by the tribe Pandionis
whose festival charges I took upon me, by the spirit of
Solon and Draco, by unmuzzled statesmen and a free people, by
martial levies and naval organization, by the virtues and the
victories of our fathers, by the affection of fellow citizens who have
crowned me many a time, and by the might of a Greece whose
guardian I have never ceased to be. Or again, if life is to be owed
to compassion, though it be mean enough, yet compassion I might
endure among the kindred of the captives I have ransomed, the
fathers whose daughters I have helped to portion, and the men
whose debts I have joined in paying.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>But if the island empire and the sea may not save me, I ask
my safety from the Posidon at whose altar and under whose sanctuary
I stand. And if Posidon's power avails not to keep his
temple inviolate, if he scorns not to surrender Demosthenes to
Archias, then welcome death; I will not transfer my worship to
Antipater. I might have had Macedonia more at my devotion
than Athens, might be now a partaker in your fortunes, if I would
have ranged myself with Callimedon, and Pytheas, and Demades.
When things were far gone, I might yet have made a shift, if I had
not had respect to the daughters of Erechtheus and to Codrus.
Fortune might desert, I would not follow her; for death is a haven
of safety, which he who reaches will do no baseness more. Archias,
I will not be at this late day a stain upon the name of Athens;
I will not make choice of slavery; be my winding-sheet the white
one of liberty.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir actor, let me recall to you a fine passage from one of your
tragedies</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6"><i>But even at the point of death</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She forethought took to fall in seemly wise</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>She was but a girl; and shall Demosthenes choose an unseemly life
before a seemly death, and forget what Xenocrates and Plato have
said of immortality?</i> And then he was stirred to some bitter
speech upon men puffed up by fortune. What remains to tell?
At last, as I now besought and now threatened, mingling the
stern and mild, 'Had I been Archias,' he said, 'I had yielded;
but seeing that I am Demosthenes, your pardon, good sir, if
my nature recoils from baseness.'</p>

<p>Then I was minded to hale him off by force. Which when
he observed, I saw him smile and glance at the God. <i>Archias</i>
(he said) <i>believes that there is no might, no refuge for the human
soul, but arms and war-ships, walls and camps. He scorns that
equipment of mine which is proof against Illyrians and Triballi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>and Macedonians, surer than that wooden wall</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> <i>of old, which the
God averred none should prevail against. Secure in this I ever
took a fearless course; fearless I braved the might of Macedonia;
little I cared for Euctemon or Aristogiton, for Pytheas and Callimedon,
for Philip in the old days, for Archias to-day.</i></p>

<p>And then, <i>Lay no hand upon me. Be it not mine to bring
outrage upon the temple; I will but greet the God, and follow of
my free will.</i> And for me, I put reliance upon this, and when
he lifted his hand to his mouth, I thought it was but to do
obeisance.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> And it was indeed&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Ar.</i> We put his servant to the question later, and learned
from her that he had long had poison by him, to give him
liberty by parting soul from body. He had not yet passed the
holy threshold, when he fixed his eye on me and said: 'Take
<i>this</i> to Antipater; Demosthenes you shall not take, no, by &mdash;&mdash;'
And methought he would have added, by the men that fell at
Marathon.</p>

<p>And with that farewell he parted. So ends, O King, the
siege of Demosthenes.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Archias, that was Demosthenes. Hail to that unconquerable
soul! how lofty the spirit, how republican the care,
that would never be parted from their warrant of freedom!
Enough; the man has gone his way, to live the life they tell
of in the Isles of the heroic Blest, or to walk the paths that, if
tales be true, the heaven-bound spirits tread; he shall attend,
surely, on none but that Zeus who is named of Freedom. For
his body, we will send it to Athens, a nobler offering to that
land than the men that died at Marathon.</p>

<h2>THE GODS IN COUNCIL</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Zeus. Hermes. Momus</i>
</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Now, gentlemen, enough of that muttering and whispering
in corners. You complain that our banquets are thrown
open to a number of undesirable persons. Very well: the
Assembly has been convened for the purpose of dealing with
this very point, and every one is at liberty to declare his sentiments
openly, and bring what allegations he will.&mdash;Hermes,
make formal proclamation to that effect.</p>

<p><i>Her.</i> All duly qualified divinities are hereby invited to address
the Assembly on the subject of foreigners and immigrants.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Have I your permission to speak, sir?</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> It is not needed; you have heard the proclamation.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> I desire, then, to protest against the insufferable vanity
of some among us who, not content with their own promotion
to godhead, would introduce their dependants and underlings
here as our equals. Sir, I shall express myself on this subject
with that blunt sincerity which is inseparable from my character.
I am known to the world as one whose unfettered tongue cannot
refrain from speech in the presence of wrong-doing; as one
who probes matters to the bottom, and says what he thinks,
without concealment, without fear, and without scruple. My
frankness is burdensome to the generality of Gods, who mistake
it for censoriousness; I have been termed by such the
Accuser General. But I shall none the less avail myself of the
freedom accorded to me by the proclamation&mdash;and by your
permission, sir&mdash;to speak my mind without reserve.&mdash;There
are, I repeat it, many persons who, despite their mixed origin,
have been admitted to our feasts and councils upon terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
equality; and who, not satisfied with this, have brought hither
their servants and satellites, and enrolled them among the
Gods; and these menials now share in our rations and sacrifices
without ever so much as paying the customary tax.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> These are riddles. Say what you mean in so many
words, and let us have the names. Generalities of this kind
can only give ground for random conjecture; they might apply
to any one. You are a friend to sincerity: speak on, then,
without hesitation.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> This is really most gratifying. Such encouragement is
precisely what I should have expected of a king of your exalted
spirit; I will mention the name. I refer, in fact, to Dionysus.
Although the mother of this truly estimable demi-god was not
only a mortal, but a barbarian, and his maternal grandfather
a tradesman in Phoenicia, one Cadmus, it was thought necessary
to confer immortality upon him. With his own conduct since
that time, I am not concerned; I shall have nothing to say on
the subject of his snood, his inebriety, or his manner of walking.
You may all see him for yourselves: an effeminate, half-witted
creature, reeking of strong liquor from the early hours of the
day. But we are indebted to him for the presence of a whole
tribe of his followers, whom he has introduced into our midst
under the title of Gods. Such are Pan, Silenus, and the Satyrs;
coarse persons, of frisky tendencies and eccentric appearance,
drawn chiefly from the goat-herd class. The first-mentioned
of these, besides being horned, has the hind-quarters of
a goat, and his enormous beard is not unlike that of the same
animal. Silenus is an old man with a bald head and a snub
nose, who is generally to be seen riding on a donkey; he is of
Lydian extraction. The Satyrs are Phrygians; they too are
bald, and have pointed ears, and sprouting horns, like those of
young kids. When I add that every one of these persons is
provided with a tail, you will realize the extent of our obliga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tion
to Dionysus. And with these theological curiosities before
their eyes, we wonder why it is that men think lightly of the
Gods! I might have added that Dionysus has also brought us
a couple of ladies: Ariadne is one, his mistress, whose crown is
now set among the host of stars; the other is farmer Icarius's
daughter. And the cream of the jest is still to come: the dog,
Erigone's dog, must be translated too; the poor child would
never be happy in Heaven without the sweet little pet! What
can we call this but a drunken freak?</p>

<p>So much for Dionysus. I now proceed&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Now, Momus, I see what you are coming to: but you
will kindly leave Asclepius and Heracles alone. Asclepius is a
physician, and restores the sick; he is</p>

<p class="center">More worth than many men.
</p>

<p>And Heracles is my own son, and purchased his immortality
with many toils. So not one word against either of them.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Very well, sir; as you wish, though I had something to
say on that subject, too. You will excuse my remarking, at
any rate, that they have something of a scorched appearance
still. With reference to yourself, sir, a good deal might be
said, if I could feel at liberty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Oh, as regards myself, you are,&mdash;perfectly at liberty.
What, then, I am an interloper too, am I?</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Worse than that, according to what they say in Crete:
your tomb is there on view. Not that <i>I</i> believe them, any
more than I believe that Aegium story, about your being a
changeling. But there is one thing that I think ought to be
made clear. You yourself, sir, have set us the example in loose
conduct of this kind; it is you we have to thank&mdash;you and your
terrestrial gallantries and your transformations&mdash;for the present
mixed state of society. We are quite uneasy about it. You
will be caught, some day, and sacrificed as a bull; or some gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>smith
will try his hand upon our gold-transmuted sire, and we
shall have nothing to show for it but a bracelet, a necklace or
a pair of earrings. The long and short of it is, that Heaven is
simply <i>swarming</i> with these demi-gods of yours; there is no
other word for it. It tickles a man considerably when he
suddenly finds Heracles promoted to deity, and Eurystheus,
his taskmaster, dead and buried, his tomb within easy distance
of his slave's temple; or again when he observes in Thebes
that Dionysus is a God, but that God's cousins, Pentheus,
Actaeon, and Learchus, only mortals, and poor devils at that.
You see, sir, ever since you gave the entr&eacute;e to people of this
sort, and turned your attention to the daughters of Earth, all
the rest have followed suit; and the scandalous part of it is,
that the Goddesses are just as bad as the Gods. Of the cases
of Anchises, Tithonus, Endymion, Iasion, and others, I need
say nothing; they are familiar to every one, and it would be
tedious to expatiate further.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Now I will have no reflections on Ganymede's antecedents;
I shall be very angry with you, if you hurt the boy's
feelings.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Ah; and out of consideration for him I suppose I must
also abstain from any reference to the eagle, which is now a God
like the rest of us, perches upon the royal sceptre, and may be
expected at any moment to build his nest upon the head of
Majesty?&mdash;Well, you must allow me Attis, Corybas, and
Sabazius: by what contrivance, now, did <i>they</i> get here? and
that Mede there, Mithras, with the candys and tiara? why,
the fellow cannot speak Greek; if you pledge him, he does not
know what you mean. The consequence is, that Scythians and
Goths, observing their success, snap their fingers at us, and
distribute divinity and immortality right and left; that was
how the slave Zamolxis's name slipped into our register. However,
let that pass. But I should just like to ask that Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
there&mdash;the dog-faced gentleman in the linen suit<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;who <i>he</i> is,
and whether he proposes to establish his divinity by barking?
And will the piebald bull yonder<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, from Memphis, explain
what use <i>he</i> has for a temple, an oracle, or a priest? As for
the ibises and monkeys and goats and worse absurdities that
are bundled in upon us, goodness knows how, from Egypt,
I am ashamed to speak of them; nor do I understand how
you, gentlemen, can endure to see such creatures enjoying
a prestige equal to or greater than your own.&mdash;And you yourself,
sir, must surely find ram's horns a great inconvenience?</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Certainly, it is disgraceful the way these Egyptians go
on. At the same time, Momus, there is an occult significance in
most of these things; and it ill becomes you, who are not of
the initiated, to ridicule them.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Oh, come now: a God is one thing, and a person with
a dog's head is another; I need no initiation to tell me that.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Well, that will do for the Egyptians; time must be
taken for the consideration of their case. Proceed to others.</p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> Trophonius and Amphilochus come next. The thought
of the latter, in particular, causes my blood to boil: the father<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
is a matricide and an outcast, and the son, if you please, sets up
for a prophet in Cilicia, and retails information&mdash;usually incorrect&mdash;to
a believing public at the rate of twopence an oracle.
That is how Apollo here has fallen into disrepute: it needs but
a quack (and quacks are plentiful), a sprinkling of oil, and
a garland or two, and an oracle may be had in these days wherever
there is an altar or a stone pillar. Fever patients may now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>be cured either at Olympia by the statue of Polydamas the
athlete, or in Thasos by that of Theagenes. Hector receives
sacrifice at Troy: Protesilaus just across the water on Chersonese.
Ever since the number of Gods has thus multiplied,
perjury and temple-robbery have been on the increase. In
short, men do not care two straws about us; nor can I blame
them.</p>

<p>That is all I have to say on the subject of bastards and new
importations. But I have also observed with considerable
amusement the introduction of various strange names, denoting
persons who neither have nor could conceivably have any
existence among us. Show me this Virtue of whom we hear so
much; show me Nature, and Destiny, and Fortune, if they
are anything more than unsubstantial names, the vain imaginings
of some philosopher's empty head. Yet these flimsy
personifications have so far gained upon the weak intelligences
of mankind, that not a man will now sacrifice to us, knowing
that though he should present us with a myriad of hecatombs,
Fortune will none the less work out that destiny which has
been appointed for each man from the beginning. I should
take it kindly of you, sir, if you would tell me whether you
<i>have</i> ever seen Virtue or Fortune or Destiny anywhere? I
know that you must have heard of them often enough, from
the philosophers, unless your ears are deaf enough to be proof
against their bawlings.</p>

<p>Much more might be said: but I forbear. I perceive that
the public indignation has already risen to hissing point;
especially in those quarters in which my plain truths have
told home.</p>

<p>In conclusion, sir, I have drawn up a bill dealing with this
subject; which, with your permission, I shall now read.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> Very well; some of your points are reasonable enough.
We must put a check on these abuses, or they will get worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mo.</i> On the seventh day of the month in the prytany of Zeus
and the presidency of Posidon Apollo in the chair the
following Bill introduced by Sleep was read by Momus
son of Night before a true and lawful meeting of the
Assembly whom Fortune direct.</p>

<p>Whereas <i>numerous persons both Greeks and barbarians being in
no way entitled to the franchise have by means unknown procured
their names to be enrolled on our register filling the Heavens with
false Gods troubling our banquets with a tumultuous rout of miscellaneous
polyglot humanity and causing a deficiency in the
supplies of ambrosia and nectar whereby the price of the latter
commodity owing to increased consumption has risen to four pounds
the half-pint</i>:</p>

<p>And whereas <i>the said persons have presumptuously forced themselves
into the places of genuine and old-established deities and in
contravention of law and custom have further claimed precedence
of the same deities upon the Earth</i>:</p>

<p>It has seemed good to the Senate and People <i>that an Assembly
be convened upon Olympus at or about the time of the winter solstice
for the purpose of electing a Commission of Inquiry the Commissioners
to be duly-qualified Gods seven in number of whom three to
be appointed from the most ancient Senate of Cronus and the
remaining four from the twelve Gods of whom Zeus to be one and
the said Commissioners shall before taking their seats swear by
Styx according to the established form and Hermes shall summon
by proclamation all such as claim admission to the Assembly to
appear and bring with them sworn witnesses together with documentary
proofs of their origin and all such persons shall successively
appear before the Commissioners and the Commissioners after
examination of their claims shall either declare them to be Gods
or dismiss them to their own tombs and family vaults and if the
Commissioners subsequently discover in Heaven any person so
disqualified from entering such person shall be thrown into Tar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>tarus
and further each God shall follow his own profession and no
other and it shall not be lawful either for Athene to heal the sick
or for Asclepius to deliver oracles or for Apollo to practise three
professions at once but only one either prophecy or music or medicine
according as he shall select and instructions shall be issued to
philosophers forbidding them either to invent meaningless names
or to talk nonsense about matters of which they know nothing and
if a temple and sacrificial honours have already been accorded to
any disqualified person his statue shall be thrown down and that
of Zeus or Hera or Athene or other God substituted in its place
and his city shall provide him with a tomb and set up a pillar in
lieu of his altar and against any person refusing to appear before
the Commissioners in accordance with the proclamation judgement
shall be given by default.</i></p>

<p>That, gentlemen, is the Bill.</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i> And a very equitable one it is, Momus. All in favour
of this Bill hold up their hands! Or no: our opponents are
sure to be in a majority. You may all go away now, and when
Hermes makes the proclamation, every one must come, bringing
with him complete particulars and proofs, with his father's and
mother's names, his tribe and clan, and the reason and circumstances
of his deification. And any of you who fail to produce
your proofs will find it is no use having great temples on the
Earth, or passing <i>there</i> for Gods; that will not help you with
the Commissioners.</p>

<h2>THE CYNIC</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Lycinus. A Cynic</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Give an account of yourself, my man. You wear a
beard and let your hair grow; you eschew shirts; you exhibit
your skin; your feet are bare; you choose a wandering, outcast,
beastly life; unlike other people, you make your own body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the object of your severities; you go from place to place sleeping
on the hard ground where chance finds you, with the result
that your old cloak, neither light nor soft nor gay to begin with,
has a plentiful load of filth to carry about with it. Why <i>is</i>
it all?</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> It meets my needs. It was easy to come by, and it
gives its owner no trouble. It is the cloak for me.</p>

<p>Pray tell me, do you not call extravagance a vice?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> And economy a virtue?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes, again.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Then, if you find me living economically, and others
extravagantly, why blame me instead of them?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I do not call your life more economical than other
people's; I call it more destitute&mdash;destitution and want, that
is what it is; you are no better than the poor who beg their
daily bread.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> That brings us to the questions, What is want, and
what is sufficiency? Shall we try to find the answers?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> If you like, yes.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> A man's sufficiency is that which meets his necessities;
will that do?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I pass that.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> And want occurs when the supply falls short of necessity&mdash;does
not meet the need?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Very well, then, I am not in want; nothing of mine
fails to satisfy my need.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> How do you make that out?</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Well, consider the purpose of anything we require; the
purpose of a house is protection?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Clothing&mdash;what is that for? protection too, I think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> But now, pray, what is the purpose of the protection,
in turn? the better condition of the protected, I
presume.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I agree.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Then do you think my feet are in worse condition than
yours?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I cannot say.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Oh, yes; look at it this way; what have feet to do?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Walk.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> And do you think my feet walk worse than yours, or
than the average man's?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh, not that, I dare say.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Then they are not in worse condition, if they do their
work as well.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> That may be so.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> So it appears that, as far as feet go, I am in no worse
condition than other people.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No, I do not think you are.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Well, the rest of my body, then? If it is in worse condition,
it must be weaker, strength being the virtue of the body.
Is mine weaker?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Not that I see.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Consequently, neither my feet nor the rest of my body
need protection, it seems; if they did, they would be in bad
condition; for want is always an evil, and deteriorates the
thing concerned. But again, there is no sign, either, of my
body's being nourished the worse for its nourishment's being
of a common sort.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> None whatever.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> It would not be healthy, if it were badly nourished; for
bad food injures the body.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> That is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> If so, it is for you to explain why you blame me and
depreciate my life and call it miserable.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Easily explained. Nature (which you honour) and the
Gods have given us the earth, and brought all sorts of good
things out of it, providing us with abundance not merely for
our necessities, but for our pleasures; and then you abstain
from all or nearly all of it, and utilize these good things no
more than the beasts. Your drink is water, just like theirs;
you eat what you pick up, like a dog, and the dog's bed is as
good as yours; straw is enough for either of you. Then your
clothes are no more presentable than a beggar's. Now, if this
sort of contentment is to pass for wisdom, God must have been
all wrong in making sheep woolly, filling grapes with wine, and
providing all our infinite variety of oil, honey, and the rest,
that we might have food of every sort, pleasant drink, money,
soft beds, fine houses, all the wonderful paraphernalia of civilization,
in fact; for the productions of art are God's gifts to us
too. To live without all these would be miserable enough even
if one could not help it, as prisoners cannot, for instance; it
is far more so if the abstention is forced upon a man by himself;
it is then sheer madness.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> You may be right. But take this case, now. A rich
man, indulging genial kindly instincts, entertains at a banquet
all sorts and conditions of men; some of them are sick, others
sound, and the dishes provided are as various as the guests.
There is one of these to whom nothing comes amiss; he has
his finger in every dish, not only the ones within easy reach, but
those some way off that were intended for the invalids; this
though he is in rude health, has not more than one stomach,
requires little to nourish him, and is likely to be upset by a surfeit.
What is your opinion of this gentleman? is he a man
of sense?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Is he temperate?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No, nor that.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Well, then there is another guest at the same table; he
seems unconscious of all that variety, fixes on some dish close
by that suits his need, eats moderately of it and confines
himself to it without a glance at the rest. You surely find
him a more temperate and better man than the other?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Do you see, or must I explain?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> That the hospitable entertainer is God, who provides
this variety of all kinds that each may have something to suit
him; this is for the sound, that for the sick; this for the strong
and that for the weak; it is not all for all of us; each is to
take what is within reach, and of that only what he most needs.</p>

<p>Now you others are like the greedy unrestrained person who
lays hands on everything; local productions will not do for
you, the world must be your storehouse; your native land
and its seas are quite insufficient; you purchase your pleasures
from the ends of the earth, prefer the exotic to the home growth,
the costly to the cheap, the rare to the common; in fact you
would rather have troubles and complications than avoid them.
Most of the precious instruments of happiness that you so pride
yourselves upon are won only by vexation and worry. Give
a moment's thought, if you will, to the gold you all pray for, to
the silver, the costly houses, the elaborate dresses, and do not
forget their conditions precedent, the trouble and toil and
danger they cost&mdash;nay, the blood and mortality and ruin; not
only do numbers perish at sea on their account, or endure
miseries in the acquisition or working of them; besides that,
they have very likely to be fought for, or the desire of them
makes friends plot against friends, children against parents,
wives against husbands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>And how purposeless it all is! embroidered clothes have no
more warmth in them than others, gilded houses keep out the
rain no better, the drink is no sweeter out of a silver cup, or
a gold one for that matter, an ivory bed makes sleep no softer;
on the contrary, your fortunate man on his ivory bed between
his delicate sheets constantly finds himself wooing sleep in vain.
And as to the elaborate dressing of food, I need hardly say that
instead of aiding nutrition it injures the body and breeds
diseases in it.</p>

<p>As superfluous to mention the abuse of the sexual instinct,
so easily managed if indulgence were not made an object. And
if madness and corruption were limited to that&mdash;; but men
must take nowadays to perverting the use of everything they
have, turning it to unnatural purposes, like him who insists on
making a carriage of a couch.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Is there such a person?</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Why, he is you; you for whom men are beasts of burden,
you who make them shoulder your couch-carriages, and loll up
there yourselves in luxury, driving your men like so many
asses and bidding them turn this way and not that; this is
one of the outward and visible signs of your happiness.</p>

<p>Again, when people use edible things not for food but to get
dye out of&mdash;the murex-dyers, for instance&mdash;are they not abusing
God's gifts?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Certainly not; the flesh of the murex can provide a pigment
as well as food.</p>

<p><i>Cy.</i> Ah, but it was not made for that. So you can <i>force</i>
a mixing-bowl to do the work of a saucepan; but that is not
what it was made for. However, it is impossible to exhaust these
people's wrong-headedness; it is endless. And because I will not
join them, you reproach me. My life is that of the orderly man
I described; I make merry on what comes to hand, use what is
cheap, and have no yearning for the elaborate and exotic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, if you think that because I need and use but few
things I live the life of a beast, that argument lands you in the
conclusion that the Gods are yet lower than the beasts; for
they have no needs at all. But to clear your ideas on the comparative
merits of great and small needs, you have only to reflect
that children have more needs than adults, women than men,
the sick than the well, and generally the inferior than the superior.
Accordingly, the Gods have no needs, and those men the fewest
who are nearest Gods.</p>

<p>Take Heracles, the best man that ever lived, a divine man,
and rightly reckoned a God; was it wrong-headedness that
made him go about in nothing but a lion's skin, insensible to
all the needs you feel? No, he was not wrong-headed, who
righted other people's wrongs; he was not poor, who was lord
of land and sea. Wherever he went, he was master; he never
met his superior or his equal as long as he lived. Do you suppose
he could not get sheets and shoes, and therefore went as
he did? absurd! he had self-control and fortitude; he wanted
power, and not luxury.</p>

<p>And Theseus his disciple&mdash;king of all the Athenians, son of 14.
Poseidon, says the legend, and best of his generation,&mdash;he too
chose to go naked and unshod; it was <i>his</i> pleasure to let his
hair and beard grow; and not his pleasure only, but all his
contemporaries'; they were better men than you, and would no
more have let you shave them than a lion would; soft smooth
flesh was very well for women, they thought; as for them,
they were men, and were content to look it; the beard was
man's ornament, like the lion's, or the horse's mane; God had
made certain beautiful and decorative additions to those creatures;
and so he had to man, in the beard. Well, I admire
those ancients and would fain be like them; I have not the
smallest admiration for the present generation's wonderful
felicity&mdash;tables! clothes! bodies artificially polished all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
over! not a hair to grow on any of the places where nature
plants it!</p>

<p>My prayer would be that my feet might be just hoofs, like
Chiron's in the story, that I might need bedclothes no more
than the lion, and costly food no more than the dog. Let my
sufficient bed be the whole earth, my house this universe, and
the food of my choice the easiest procurable. May I have no
need, I nor any that I call friend, of gold and silver. For all
human evils spring from the desire of these, seditions and wars,
conspiracies and murders. The fountain of them all is the
desire of more. Never be that desire mine; let me never wish
for more than my share, but be content with less.</p>

<p>Such are our aspirations&mdash;considerably different from other
people's. It is no wonder that our get-up is peculiar, since the
peculiarity of our underlying principle is so marked. I cannot
make out why you allow a harpist his proper robe and get-up&mdash;and
so the flute-player has his, and the tragic actor his&mdash;,
but will not be consistent and recognize any uniform for a good
man; the good man must be like every one else, of course,
regardless of the fact that every one else is all wrong. Well, if
the good are to have a uniform of their own, there can be none
better than that which the average sensual man will consider
most improper, and reject with most decision for himself.</p>

<p>Now my uniform consists of a rough hairy skin, a threadbare
cloak, long hair, and bare feet, whereas yours is for all the world
that of some minister to vice; there is not a pin to choose
between you&mdash;the gay colours, the soft texture, the number of
garments you are swathed in, the shoes, the sleeked hair, the
very scent of you; for the more blessed you are, the more do you
exhale perfumes like his. What value can one attach to a man
whom one's nose would identify for one of those minions?
The consequence is, you are equal to no more work than they
are, and to quite as much pleasure. You feed like them, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sleep like them, you walk like them&mdash;except so far as you avoid
walking by getting yourselves conveyed like parcels by porters
or animals; as for me, my feet take me anywhere that I want
to go. I can put up with cold and heat and be content with
the works of God&mdash;such a miserable wretch am I&mdash;, whereas
you blessed ones are displeased with everything that happens
and grumble without ceasing; what is is intolerable, what is
not you pine for, in winter for summer, in summer for winter,
in heat for cold, in cold for heat, as fastidious and peevish as
so many invalids; only their reason is to be found in their
illness, and yours in your characters.</p>

<p>And then, because we occasionally make mistakes in practice,
you recommend us to change our plan and correct our principles,
the fact being that you in your own affairs go quite at
random, never acting on deliberation or reason, but always on
habit and appetite. You are no better than people washed
about by a flood; they drift with the current, you with your
appetites. There is a story of a man on a vicious horse that
just gives your case. The horse ran away with him, and at
the pace it was going at he could not get off. A man in the
way asked him where he was off to; 'wherever this beast
chooses,' was the reply. So if one asked you where you were
bound for, if you cared to tell the truth you would say either
generally, wherever your appetites chose, or in particular,
where pleasure chose to-day, where fancy chose to-morrow,
and where avarice chose another day; or sometimes it is rage,
sometimes fear, sometimes any other such feeling, that takes you
whither it will. You ride not one horse, but many at different
times, all vicious, and all out of control. They are carrying
you straight for pits and cliffs; but you do not realize that you
are bound for a fall till the fall comes.</p>

<p>The old cloak, the shaggy hair, the whole get-up that you
ridicule, has this effect: it enables me to live a quiet life, doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
as I will and keeping the company I want. No ignorant uneducated
person will have anything to say to one dressed like
this; and the soft livers turn the other way as soon as I am in
sight. But the refined, the reasonable, the earnest, seek me
out; they are the men who seek me, because they are the men
I wish to see. At the doors of those whom the world counts
happy I do not dance attendance; their gold crowns and their
purple I call ostentation, and them I laugh to scorn.</p>

<p>These externals that you pour contempt upon, you may
learn that they are seemly enough not merely for good men, but
for Gods, if you will look at the Gods' statues; do those resemble
you, or me? Do not confine your attention to Greece; take
a tour round the foreign temples too, and see whether the
Gods treat their hair and beards like me, or let the painters
and sculptors shave them. Most of them, you will find, have
no more shirt than I have, either. I hope you will not venture
to describe again as mean an appearance that is accepted as
godlike.</p>

<h2>THE PURIST PURIZED</h2>


<p class="center"><i>Lycinus. Purist</i>
</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Are you the man whose scent is so keen for a blunder,
and who is himself blunder-proof?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I think I may say so.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I suppose one must be blunder-proof, to detect the man
who is not so?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Assuredly.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Do I understand that you are proof?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> How could I call myself educated, if I made blunders at
my age?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, shall you be able to detect a culprit, and convict
him if he denies it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Of course I shall.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Catch me out, then; I will make one just now.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Say on.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, the deed is done, and you have missed it.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> You are joking, of course?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> No, upon my honour. The blunder is made, and you
none the wiser. Well, try again; but you are not infallible on
these sort of things.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Again, the blunder made, and you unconscious.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> How can that be, before you have opened your lips?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Oh yes, I opened them, and to a blunder; but you never
see them. I quite doubt you seeing this one even.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Well, there is something very queer about it if I do not
know a solecism when I hear it.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> One begins to doubt, when a man has missed three.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Three? What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> A complete triolet of them.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> You are certainly joking.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> And you are as certainly a poor detective.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> If you were to say something, one might have a chance.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Four chances you have had, and no result. It would
have been a fine feather in your hat to have got them all.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Nothing fine about it; it is no more than I undertook.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, there you are again!</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Again?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> 'Feather in your hat'!</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Precisely; you do not know. And now suppose you go
first; you do not like following, that is what it is; you understand,
if you chose.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Oh, I am willing enough; only you have not made any
solecisms in the usual sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> How about that last? Now watch me well, as you did
not get me that time.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I cannot say I did.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Now for a rabbit, then; there, that's him! Has he got
by? There he is, that's him, I tell you. Hims enough to fill
a warren, if you don't wake up.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Oh, I am wide awake.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, they are gone.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Never!</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> The fact is, your too much learning renders you unconscious
to solecisms; whatever case I take, it is always the
same.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> What you mean by that I am sure I don't know; but
I have often caught people out in blunders.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, you will catch me about the time that you are
a sucking child again. By the way, a babe laying in his cradle
would hardly jar on your notions of grammar, if you have not
yet got me.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Well, I am convinced.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Now, if we cannot detect blunders like these, we are not
likely to know much about our own; you see, you have just
missed another. Very well now, never again call yourself competent
either to detect blunders or to avoid them.</p>

<p>This is my blunt way, you see. Socrates of Mopsus, with
whom I was acquainted in Egypt, used to put his corrections
more delicately, so as not to humiliate the offender. Here are
some specimens:</p>

<p>What time do you set out on your travels?&mdash;What time?
Oh, I see, you thought I started to-day.</p>

<p>The patrimonial income supplies me well enough.&mdash;Patrimonial?
But your father is not dead?</p>

<p>So-and-so is a tribes-man of mine.&mdash;Oh, you are a savage,
are you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The fellow is a boozy.&mdash;Oh, Boozy was his mother's name,
was it?</p>

<p>Worser luck I never knew.&mdash;Well, you need not make it
worserer.</p>

<p>I always said he had a good 'eart.&mdash;Yes, quite an artist.</p>

<p>So glad to see you, old cock!&mdash;Come, allow me humanity.</p>

<p>Contemptuous fellow! I would not go near him.&mdash;If he
were contemptible, it would not matter, I suppose.</p>

<p>He is the most unique of friends.&mdash;Good; one likes degrees
in uniqueness.</p>

<p>How aggravating!&mdash;Indeed? what does it aggravate?</p>

<p>So I ascended up.&mdash;Ingenious man, doubling your speed like
that.</p>

<p>I had to do it; I was in an engagement.&mdash;Like Xenophon's
hoplites.</p>

<p>I got round him.&mdash;Comprehensive person.</p>

<p>They went to law, but were compounded.&mdash;You don't say
they didn't get apart again?</p>

<p>He would apply the same delicate treatment to people unsound
in their Attic.</p>

<p>'That's the truth of it,' said some one, 'between you and I.'
'Ah no, you will have to admit that you and me are wrong
there.'</p>

<p>Another person giving a circumstantial account of a local
legend said: 'So when she mingled with Heracles&mdash;' 'Without
Heracles's mingling with her?'</p>

<p>He asked a man who told him that he must have a close crop,
what his particular felony had been.</p>

<p>'There I quarrel,' said his opponent in an argument. 'It
takes two to make a quarrel.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>When some one described his sick servant as undergoing
torture, he asked, 'What for? what do they suppose they are
going to get out of him?'</p>

<p>Some one was said to be going ahead in his studies. 'Let
me see,' he said; 'it is Plato, I think, who calls that making
progress.'</p>

<p>'Will we have a fine day?' 'If God shall.'</p>

<p>'Archaist, curse not thy friend!' he retorted, to a man
who called him curst instead of crusty.</p>

<p>A man once used the phrase, 'I was trying to save his face.'
'But is he in any danger of losing it?' asked Socrates.</p>

<p>'Chided,' said one man, 'chode,' another. He disclaimed
all acquaintance with either form.</p>

<p>A person who volunteered 'but and if' was commended for
his generosity.</p>

<p>Some one tried him with 'y-pleased'; 'no, no,' said he;
'that is too much of a good thing.'</p>

<p>'I expect him momently,' some one announced. 'A good
phrase,' he said; 'so is "minutely"; we have excellent authority
for "daily."'</p>

<p>'Look you!' said a man, meaning 'look.' 'Yes, what am
I to look you at?'</p>

<p>He took up a man who said, 'Yes, I can grapple with that,'
meaning that he understood, with 'Oh, you are going to throw
me, are you? how?'</p>

<p>'How shrill those fives are!' said some one. 'Oh, come
now,' said Socrates; 'seditions and strives, but not drums and
fives.'</p>

<p>'That man is heavily weighed,' one man observed. 'You
are quite right; there is no such word as weighted.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>'He has thrived on it,' some one assured him. 'The people
among whom he has thrived cannot be very particular.'</p>

<p>People were very fond of calling it at-one-ment. 'Yes, all
right,' he would say; 'I know what it means.'</p>

<p>Mention being made of a black-hen, he supposed that would
be the female of the grey-cock.</p>

<p>Some one said he had been eating sparrowgrass. 'You'll be
trying groundsel next,' was his comment.</p>

<p>But enough of Socrates. Shall we have another match on
the old lines? I will give you nothing but first-rate ones.
Have your eyes open. You will surely be able to do it now,
after hearing such a list of them.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I am by no means so sure of that. Proceed, however.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Not sure? well, but here you have the door broad
open.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Say on.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> I have said.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Nothing that I observed.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> What, not observed 'broad open'?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well, what is to happen, if you cannot follow now?
Every man can crow on his own hay-cock, and I thought this
was yours. Did you get that hay-cock? You don't seem to
attend; look at the mutual help Socrates and I have just given
you.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I am attending; but you are so sly with them.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Monstrous sly, is it not, to say 'mutual' instead of
'joint'? Well, that is settled up; but for your general ignorance,
I defy any God short of Apollo to cure it. He gives
council to all who ask it; but on you that council is thrown
away.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Yes, I declare, so it was!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Perhaps one at a time are too few?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> I think that must be it.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> How did 'one are' get past you?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Ah, I didn't see it, again.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> By the way, do you know of any one who is on the look
in for a wife?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> What <i>are</i> you talking about?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Show me the man who is on the look in, and I will show
you a solecist.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> But what have I to do with solecists on the look in for
wives?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Ah, if you knew that, you would be the man you pretend
to be. So much for that. Now, if a man came to you and said
that he had left his wife's home, would you stand that?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Of course I should, if he had provocation.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> And if you caught him committing a solecism, would you
stand it?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Quite right too. We should never permit solecisms in
a friend, but teach him better. Now, what are your feelings
when you hear a man deprecating his own merits, and depreciating
his friend's excessive gratitude?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Feelings? only that he shows a very proper feeling.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Then, as you cannot feel the difference between 'deprecate'
and 'depreciate,' shall we conclude that you are an
ignoramus?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Outrageous insolence!</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Outrageous? I shall be, ere much, if I go on talking
to you.&mdash;Now I should have said that 'ere much' was a blunder,
but it does not strike you so.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Oh, stop, for goodness' sake! Look here, try this
way; I want to get <i>my</i> profit out of it too.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Suppose you were to go through all the blunders you
say I have missed, and tell me what is the right thing for each.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Good gracious, no; it would take us till midnight. No;
you can look those out for yourself. Meanwhile, we had better
take fresh ones, as we have only a quarter of an hour (by the
way, never pronounce the 'h' in hour; that sounds dreadful).
Then as to that outrage which you say I have committed upon
you; if I were to speak of an outrage committed <i>against</i> you,
that would be another thing.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Would it?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes; an outrage <i>upon</i> you must be committed upon you
personally, in the shape of blows, interference with your liberty,
or the like. An outrage <i>against</i> you is upon something that
belongs to you; he who does an outrage upon your wife, child,
friend, or slave, does it against you. This distinction, however,
does not apply to inanimate things. An 'outrage against' is
a legitimate phrase with them, as when Plato talks in the
<i>Symposium</i> of an outrage against a proverb.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Ah, I see now.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Do you also see that the exchange of one for the other is
a solecism?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Yes, I shall know that for the future.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> And if a person were to use 'interchange' there instead
of 'exchange,' what would you take him to mean?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Just the same.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Why, how can they be equivalent? Exchange is merely
the substitution of one expression for another, the improper
for the proper; whereas interchange involves a false statement<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Pur.</i> I see now; exchange is the use of a loose instead of
a precise expression, while interchange is the use of both expressions,
each in the other's place.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> These subtleties are not unpleasing. Similarly, when
we are concerned <i>with</i> a person, it is in our own interest; but
when we are concerned <i>for</i> him, it is in his. It is true the
phrases are sometimes confused, but there are those who observe
the distinction; and it is as well to be on the safe side.</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Quite true.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Now, can you tell me the difference between 'setting'
and 'sitting,' or between 'be seated' and 'sit'?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> No; but I have heard you say that 'sit yourself' is
a barbarism.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Yes, quite so; but now I tell you that 'be seated' is
not the same as 'sit.'</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> Why, what may the difference be?</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> When a man is on his legs, you can only tell him to be
seated; but if he is seated already, you can tell him to sit still.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>Sit where thou art; we find us seats elsewhere.
It means 'remain sitting,' you see. Here again we have to
say that it is a mistake to reverse the expressions. And as to
'set' and 'sit,' surely it is the whole difference between transitive
and intransitive?</p>

<p><i>Pur.</i> That is clear enough; go on; this is the way to teach.</p>

<p><i>Ly.</i> Or the only way you can learn? Well, do you know
what a historian is?</p>

<p>(<i>The explanation of this point appears to have dropped out of

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The words here represented by 'exchange' and 'interchange' are the
Greek verbs from which are derived the grammarian's names for the (not
very clearly distinguished) figures of speech, Hypallage and Enallage. We
take it, however, that 'exchange' and 'interchange' give the distinction
fairly in the present context, the former indicating a single, the latter a
mutual substitution between two terms. For if one of the two differs from
the other in being more comprehensive, as 'outrage against' is more comprehensive
than 'outrage upon,' it is then true that the substitution of the
more for the less comprehensive has no worse effect than making the statement
lack precision, while the double substitution produces a false statement.
</p>
<p>
Let it be supposed that <i>A</i> kicks <i>B's</i> dog. Four descriptions are conceivable:&mdash;
</p>

<ul><li>(1) It is an outrage upon the dog.</li>
<li>(2) It is an outrage against <i>B</i>.</li>
<li>(3) It is an outrage against the dog.</li>
<li>(4) It is an outrage upon <i>B</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first two can both be stated; each is true, and each is precise. (3) can
also be stated; 'exchange' has taken place; the more comprehensive term
has been substituted; the statement is true, but not precise. But if (3) and
(4) are both stated, 'interchange' has taken place; the less comprehensive
has been substituted for the more, as well as <i>vice versa</i>; and (4) is not only
not precise, it is false.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Academy.</span> A grove or garden in the suburbs of Athens, in
which Plato taught; afterwards used as a name for the school of
philosophy that acknowledged him as its founder. For Plato's
characteristic doctrines, see under <span class="smcap">Plato</span>. Lucian's references
to the school are (1) as eristic or argumentative. The Socratic
method of eliciting truth being by discussion, and the Academy
being descended from Socrates through Plato, it might be
regarded as especially argumentative. (2) as disputing the
possibility of judgement, and urging suspension. The Academy
is divided into the Old, Middle, and New, of which the Middle
Academy neglected the positive teachings of Plato, and developed
rather the destructive analytic method of Socrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Croesus.</span> King of Lydia, 560-546 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> To test Apollo's
oracle, he asked what he would be doing on a certain day. The
answer was, 'boiling tortoise and lamb,' which was correct.
Thus convinced, he gave great gifts to the oracle, including
golden bricks, and, acting on another oracle, which said that he
by crossing the Halys should destroy a mighty empire, attacked
Cyrus, king of Persia, who subdued and deposed him. Thus
was verified the warning given to him by Solon, in the famous
conversation reported in the <i>Charon</i>. The story of his son
Atys is given in <i>Zeus Cross-examined</i> (12). His other son was
born deaf and dumb, but when his father was in danger from
Cyrus's soldiers, was enabled to say: Do not kill the king. His
name is a commonplace for wealth and vicissitudes.</p>

the first of whom deposed him. The time of his reign was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
looked back to as the Golden Age of plenty, equality, and virtue.
The Saturnalia, or feast of the Latin God Saturn, who was
commonly identified with Cronus, was a symbolic revival of
that golden age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ctesias.</span> Author of (1) a long history of Persia, probably
a really valuable work, and (2) a treatise on India, the fables
mixed up in which caused him to be looked upon as an author
who deserved no credit. He was a Greek physician at the court
of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Flourished about 401 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynics.</span> A school of philosophers, so called either because
Antisthenes the Athenian, their founder (born 444 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and
a pupil of Socrates, taught in the gymnasium called the Cynosarges,
or else because their mode of life was regarded as no
better than that of a dog (cyn-). Diogenes, Crates, Menippus,
and (in his own time) Demonax, are mentioned by Lucian as
favourable specimens of the school. Their ideal may be said
to have been plain living and high thinking; virtue is the only
good; the essence of virtue is self-control; pleasure is an evil
if sought for itself. The dialogue called <i>The Cynic</i> gives a not
unfair view of their asceticism. The <i>Peregrine</i> and <i>The Runaways</i>
illustrate the abuses to which this philosophy was liable,
owing to the small intellectual demand it made, and the pride
it generated. The Cynics were cosmopolitan, individualist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
outspoken; their repulsive personal negligence, and their free
use of their philosophic staves as offensive weapons, are often
alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynuria.</span> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Othryades</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyrenaics.</span> Aristippus, the founder of this school, was a
disciple of Socrates, but developed only the practical side
of his master's philosophy. Since the only things of which
we can be absolutely certain are our sensations of pleasure and
pain, all our actions should be calculated with a view to securing
the one and avoiding the other. The principle is not so
debased as it sounds, since there are higher and lower pleasures,
present and future gratifications. Epicureanism and modern
Utilitarianism are developments.</p>

the sea that was afterwards called after him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Danae.</span> Daughter of Acrisius (upon whose name there is
a jest in the <i>Demonax</i>), king of Argos. Her father, anxious that
she should not have a child, confined her in a brazen tower:
but, Zeus visiting her in a shower of gold, she gave birth to
Perseus. Mother and child were thrown into the sea in a chest,
but were saved.</p>

took to oratory first for the purpose of suing them. His self-training
is famous; the allusions in the <i>Demosthenes</i> are thus
explained: he lived in a cave to study undisturbed, shaving
half his head to keep him there, studied his gestures in a mirror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and corrected a shrug by hanging a naked sword over his shoulders
improved his articulation and voice by holding pebbles in his

<p><span class="smcap">Peripatetics.</span> Aristotle of Stagira (385-323 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), the founder

Lyceum, a public garden at Athens. The name Peripatetic
refers to his habit of walking about while lecturing. Forty-six
of his works remain, though perhaps only in the form of notes.
They are remarkable for the rigidly systematic treatment applied
to all subjects alike, to Ethics and Poetry, not less than to
Zoology and Mechanics. Most notable of his doctrines is that
which refers all definable things to four Causes, viz., Matter,
the existence of which is Potentiality, and the Moving, Final,
and Formal Causes, whose operation is included under the
general term Energy; the combination of Potentiality and
Energy resulting in the perfection of the completed thing.
The <i>summum bonum</i>, according to Aristotle, is Eudaemonia
(Happiness); and each virtue is the mean between the excess and
defect of some quality. The virtuous mean between avarice
and profuseness, or between luxury and asceticism, might
perhaps involve that respect for money with which Lucian
reproaches the Peripatetics. The ten Categories, or Predicaments,
were an attempt to classify all existing things; among
them were Substance, Quality, Quantity, Relation, Time, and
Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosophy.</span> Lucian is fond of ridiculing the different schools

and Sicily, and returned to Athens in 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> to lecture in the
gymnasium of the Academy. He paid three visits to the Syracusan
court of Dionysius I and II. The Platonic theory of
Ideas is an attempt to secure accuracy of definition (which is
the first step towards knowledge), by contemplation of those
abstract types or Ideas of things, of which external objects are
in every case only an imperfect manifestation, and which are
perceptible to us by reason of our familiarity with them in
a previous existence; for the soul is immortal, and what
we call the acquisition of knowledge is in fact only recollection.
In his <i>Republic</i> we have a sketch of a model state, in
which philosophers are to be kings, and community of
women is recommended as a means of securing scientific
breeding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prometheus.</span> Son of Iapetus, and therefore first cousin of
Zeus, who nailed him up on the Caucasus, and instructed
an eagle to devour his liver, which grew again each night. The
provocation had been threefold: (1) Prometheus, forming clay
figures, had persuaded Athene to breathe life into them, and
thus created man; (2) he had stolen fire from Heaven for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
use of man; (3) by dividing a slain animal into two portions,
one consisting of bones wrapped up in fat, the other of the lean
parts, and persuading Zeus to choose the former as his share, he
had secured the more desirable portion of sacrificial animals for
man. The confusion of the sexes alluded to in the <i>Literary
Prometheus</i> (7) is perhaps drawn from Plato's account in the
<i>Symposium</i> of the creation of double beings, who possessed the
characteristics of both sexes, and referred by Lucian to Prometheus
on his own responsibility; though in Phaedrus (Fables,

<p><span class="smcap">Puzzles.</span> Lucian is never tired of ridiculing the verbal
quibbles in which the philosophers of his time indulged. He
attributes them especially to the Stoics, whose insistence on
pure reason, as opposed to emotion, for the guide of life, resulted
in much attention to logic, including its paradoxical
forms. Among these logical puzzles are the following: (1)
Sorites, the heap trick. Suppose a heap of corn. Is it a heap?
Yes. Take a grain away. Is it a heap? Yes. And so on,
till only one grain is left. The drawing of the line is impossible.
(2) The Horns. If you have not lost a thing, you still have it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Certainly. Have you lost your horns? No. Then you are
horned. (3) The Crocodile. A child is caught by a crocodile;
the father asks him to give it back. I will, says the crocodile,
on condition that you tell me correctly whether I shall do so
or not. The dilemma is obvious. (4) The Day and Night.
This appears to be a proof that there is no such thing as night,
through the ambiguity in 'Day being, Night cannot be,' which
in Greek, though not in English, is equally natural in the sense
of Since it is day, it cannot be night, and, if day exists, night
cannot. (5) The Reaper. I will prove to you that you will
not reap your corn, thus. If you reap it, you will not either-reap-or-not-reap,
but reap. If you do not reap it, you will
not either-reap-or-not-reap, but not reap. So in each case you
will not either reap or not reap, that is, there will be no reaping.
(6) The Rightful Owner. Unexplained; but <i>see</i> Epictetus, ii,
xix. (7) and (8) The Electra, and The Man in the Hood,
sufficiently explained in <i>Sale of Creeds</i> (22).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pythagoras.</span> Born at Samos, settled at Croton in Italy.
580-510 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The early Ionic philosophers, as Thales and
Heraclitus, had found the origin of all things in some one principle,
as water, or fire. Pythagoras found it in number and
proportion; hence the name Order (&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;), which he first
gave to the universe; hence also the mystic importance attached
to certain numbers, e.g. the Decad, called Tetractys (which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
have translated 'quaternion') as made by the addition of the
first four integers (1+2+3+4=10), and the Pentagram, or
figure resulting from the production of all the sides of a regular
pentagon till they intersect. Pythagoras had travelled in Egypt,
and perhaps brought thence his most famous doctrines of the
immortality of the soul and transmigration; he is said to have
retained the memory of his own previous existences, especially
as Euphorbus the Trojan, whose shield he recognized; human
knowledge, for him as for Plato, would be accounted for as
recollection from earlier lives. He instituted a brotherhood of
his disciples, with elaborate training and different degrees; and
the Pythagorean 'Ipse dixit,' implying that what the master
had said was not open to argument, marks the strict subordination;
a novice had to observe silence for five years. Pythagoras
left no writings, and this, combined with the mystic
character of his speculations on number and his specially authoritative
position, gave occasion to innumerable legends, misrepresentations,
and extensions. The Pythagorean prohibition of
beans as food has never been explained; <i>see</i> Mayor's note on
Juv. xv. 174. The usual account is that he thought the souls
of his parents might be in them. The story of his appearing
at the Olympic games with a golden thigh is one of the later
legends illustrative of his supposed assumption of superhuman
qualities, which made him the model of impostors or half-impostors
like Apollonius of Tyana, Alexander of Abonutichus,
or Paracelsus.</p>

He abandoned sculpture (his father's profession) for the study
of philosophy, in which he was remarkable for the preference
that he gave to ethics over physics, and for the method of
dialectic, or logical conversation carried on by means of question
and answer, for the purpose of eliciting accurate definition. He
was frequently ridiculed on the comic stage by Aristophanes
and other poets. In 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> a charge of impiety was brought
against him by Anytus and Meletus, and he was condemned to
drink hemlock. Socrates served with credit at the battle of
Delium, 424 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> An oracle given to his disciple Chaerephon
pronounced Socrates to be the wisest of men: Socrates himself
claimed to know one thing only&mdash;that he knew nothing. Lucian
alludes to his favourite oaths, the dog and plane-tree. For the

<p><span class="smcap">Stoics.</span> School of philosophy, so called from the Stoa
Poecile, or Painted Porch, at Athens, in which Zeno their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
founder taught. Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, were the first
three heads, starting 310 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Stoicism was a great influence
among the Romans, as with the emperor M. Aurelius. Its
aim was purely practical, to make man independent of his
surroundings. The 'wise man,' who formed his views on pure
reason, would recognize that virtue or duty was the only end,
and that pleasure and pain, wealth, power, and everything else
that did not depend on his own choice, were 'things indifferent.'
He would ultimately attain to 'apathy,' and be completely
unmoved by the ordinary objects of desire or aversion, being, in
whatever external condition, the 'only king,' the 'only happy.'
They paid great attention to logic, much reasoning being
necessary to establish these paradoxes, whence their reputation
for verbal quibbles, and their elaborate technical terms for the
relations between sensation and the mental processes. Later
Stoics relaxed the severity of the 'indifference' doctrine by
dividing <i>indifferentia</i> into <i>praeposita</i> and <i>rejecta</i>; e.g. health
was to be preferred to sickness, though virtue was consistent
with either. This would open the door to the preference of
wealth, and account for Lucian's sneer at Stoic usurers. The
Stoic physics was a materialistic pantheism.</p>

Giants afterwards revolted, but were crushed with the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of Hera. Zeus now became the father of Persephone by Demeter,
of the Muses by Mnemosyne, of Apollo and Artemis by
Leto, of Hebe, Ares, and Ilithyia by Hera, and of Athene,
who was born from his head. He was the lover also of the
mortals, Danae, Semele, Europa, Io, and many others, in various
disguises. On one occasion Posidon, Hera, and Athene conspired
against him, but were frustrated by Thetis and Briareus.
Zeus in gratitude, at the request of Thetis, punished the Greeks,
for their ill-treatment of Achilles by persuading Agamemnon,
with a lying dream to make a premature attack upon Troy.
His superiority to the other Gods is expressed in the boast
alluded to in <i>Dialogues of the Gods</i>, xxi. Lucian also refers to
the Cretan story, according to which Zeus lay buried in that
island. His usual attributes are the sceptre, the eagle, and the
thunderbolt. The famous statue of Zeus at Olympia was by
Phidias. In Egypt he was identified with Ammon.</p>
